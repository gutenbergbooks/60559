<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is now five years since the present
volume was first laid before the public
by Mr. George Smith, just before setting
out on his last ill-fated expedition to the
East. It naturally awakened extreme interest and
curiosity. The earlier chapters of Genesis no longer
stood alone. Parallel accounts had been discovered
by the author among the clay records of ancient
Babylonia, which far exceeded in antiquity the venerable
histories of the Bible. All those who had a
theory to support, or a tradition to overthrow, turned
eagerly to the newly-discovered documents, which
possessed an equal interest for the students of history,
of religion, and of language.</p>

<p>The five years that have elapsed since the publication
of “The Chaldean Account of Genesis” have
been five years of active work and progress among
Assyrian scholars. The impulse given to Assyrian
research by Mr. Smith has survived his death; numberless
new tablets and fragments of tablets have been
brought to Europe from Assyria and Babylonia; fresh
students of the inscriptions have risen up in this country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
and on the continent, more especially in Germany; and
the scientific spirit which has been introduced into
the study of the Assyrian language has immeasurably
increased our knowledge of it. Thanks to the labours
of men like Oppert, Lenormant and Guyard in France,
or of Schrader, Delitzsch, Haupt and Hommel in
Germany, texts which were obscure and doubtful at
the time of Mr. Smith’s death have now become
almost as clear as a page of the more difficult portions
of the Old Testament. The Assyrian student,
moreover, has an advantage which the Hebrew student
has not; he possesses dictionaries and vocabularies
compiled by the Assyro-Babylonians themselves,
and these frequently throw light on a word
which otherwise would be a “hapax legomenon.”</p>

<p>The more backward condition of our knowledge of
Assyrian, however, was not the only difficulty against
which Mr. Smith had to contend. He was pressed
for time when writing the present volume, which had
to be finished before his departure for the East.
The class of texts, also, which he had brought to
light was a new class hitherto unknown, or almost
unknown, to the Assyrian decipherer. He had to
break fresh ground in dealing with them. Their
style differed considerably from that of the texts
previously studied; they had a vocabulary of their
own, allusions of their own, and even, it may be
added, a grammar of their own. If the texts had
been complete the difficulty perhaps would not have
been so great; but it was enormously increased by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
their mutilated condition. The skill and success with
which Mr. Smith struggled against all these difficulties
show more plainly than ever what a loss Assyrian
research has sustained in him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even the genius of Mr. Smith could
not do more than give a general idea of the contents
of the fragments, and not always even this. A comparison
of the translations contained in the present
edition with those contained in the preceding ones
will show to what an extent the details of translation
have had to be modified and changed, sometimes with
important consequences. Thus the corrected translation
of the fragments relating to the Tower of
Babel will remove the doubts raised by Mr. Smith’s
translation as to his correctness in associating them
with that event; thus, too, the corrected rendering
of a passage in the Izdubar Epic will show that the
practice of erecting a Bethel or sacred stone was
familiar to the early Babylonians. In some instances
Mr. Smith has misconceived the true character of a
whole text. What he believed to be a record of the
Fall, for instance, is really, as M. Oppert first
pointed out, a hymn to the Creator.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fresh materials that have
been acquired by the British Museum during the
last five years, or a closer examination of the treasures
it already possessed, have enabled us to add to
the number of cuneiform texts which illustrate the
earlier portions of Genesis. Mr. Rassam, for example,
has brought home a fragment of the Deluge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
tablet, which not only helps us to fill up some of the
<i>lacunæ</i> in the text, but is also important in another
way. It is written, not in Assyrian, but in Babylonian
cuneiform characters, and comes, not from an Assyrian,
but from a Babylonian library. But it agrees exactly
with the corresponding parts of the Assyrian editions
of the story, and thus furnishes us with a proof of the
trustworthiness of the Assyrian copies of the old
Babylonian texts. The text, again, which relates to
the destruction of a country by a rain of fire, though
long contained in the British Museum Collection,
was first noticed by myself as being apparently the
Babylonian version of the biblical account of the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>

<p>Numerous alterations and insertions have had to
be made in the text which accompanies the translations.
The latter necessarily occupied the main
part of Mr. Smith’s attention; he had neither time
nor inclination to enter very elaborately into the
questions raised by them, or the illustrations they
might receive from elsewhere. In fact, any adequate
treatment of the great Izdubar Epic, for instance,
demanded a special acquaintance with the method
and results of Comparative Philology, as well as a
more intimate knowledge of its history and character
than was possible at the time when Mr. Smith
wrote.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the cuneiform texts from
which the translations contained in the present volume
are made has not yet been published. I have, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>ever,
gone carefully over them all with the exception
of a small portion of the Izdubar Epic, and endeavoured
to bring the translations up to the level of
our present knowledge of the Assyrian language. I
am indebted to the ready kindness and accurate eye
of Mr. Pinches for copies of almost all the unpublished
portions of the Izdubar legends. In these he
has corrected several faulty readings, more especially
that of the name of the pilot of Xisuthrus, which
ought to be Nes-Hea, “the lion of Hea.” Mr. Pinches
assures me that the name of the deity composing the
second part of the name is invariably written with
the numeral 40, the symbol of the god Hea, except
once when the scribe has miswritten 50, the symbol
of Bel, and he has pointed out to me a passage in a
bilingual tablet where the name is explained in
Assyrian by Nes-Hea. Unfortunately, the texts
given in pp. 103-124 cannot be found, and here therefore
I have been obliged to leave Mr. Smith’s translations
unaltered.</p>

<p>The reader, however, must remember that no
translations of these mutilated tablets can be more
than approximately correct. Even if the meaning
of all the words were well known, and they were
divided from one another (which is not the case), the
broken condition of so many of the inscriptions would
make a good deal of the translation more or less
conjectural. This must be doubly the case where
the signification of the words is either unknown or
only half known. I have always endeavoured to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
indicate a doubtful word or passage by a query; but
there must be instances in which the meaning that I
believe ought to be assigned to particular words will
be corrected by the further progress of discovery.
This is even more true of what may be termed the
commentary accompanying the translations. Surprises
are constantly in store for the Assyrian decipherer,
and a tiny fragment may suddenly throw a
new light on a question he had supposed to be
settled. In fact, in Assyriology, as in all other
branches of science, there is no finality; we cannot
be more than approximately exact at any given time,
and every month enables us to introduce fresh corrections
and improvements into our work.</p>

<p>A fresh illustration of the fact has been afforded
even while the present volume has been passing
through the press. Mr. Pinches has come across
two fragments (one marked S 669, the other unnumbered)
which belong to two separate copies or editions
of a very interesting work. This is nothing less
than a list of the ancient epics and legends of
Chaldea, along with the names of their reputed
authors, many of whom, however, are probably as
mythical as the famous Rishis of India. The list
shows how numerous these early poems were, and
how few of them, comparatively, we possess at
present. Both fragments belong to the same part of
the list, and we are therefore ignorant of many of the
ancient compositions it must originally have contained.
Some of the works mentioned receive their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
names from the heroes celebrated in them, others are
named from their opening lines. A distinction is
drawn between those that belonged to the Accadian
period, and were written by Accadian poets in the
Accadian language, and those that were of Semitic
Babylonian origin. The interest of the list is enhanced
by the great antiquity of the poems it records,
none of them being later than about 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
Here is a translation of the text as restored from a
comparison of the two fragments according to the
copies I have made of them:—</p>

</ul>

<p>What is meant by the phrase “the man of a non-existent
tablet,” I do not know. Possibly it signifies
that the autograph of the author no longer existed at
the time the list was drawn up. “The Bull of the
firmament” was a legend which was probably connected
with the second month of the year, originally,
it would seem, the first, which like the zodiacal sign
after which it was named, was called the month of
“the directing bull.”</p>

<p>Future excavations will doubtless bring to light
some of the poems mentioned in the list and not
previously known. I have myself lately come across
two fragments (S 802 and S 316) which belong to
legends hitherto unknown, but they are too short to
be worth translating. What curious revelations,
however, we may yet expect from the cuneiform
records may be judged from a small and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>well preserved
tablet recently brought to England, which
contains a catalogue of the gardens belonging to
Merodach-Baladan, the contemporary of Hezekiah, and
grouped according to the districts in which they were
situated. Merodach-Baladan must have been fond of
horticulture, since the catalogue contains the names
of no less than sixty-seven seed-gardens, besides six
other pleasure-grounds. Many of them were named
from the localities in whose neighbourhood they
were, but others bore such significant titles as “the
forest of reeds,” “the small enclosure,” or “the
garden of the waters of the city.” As the tablet
was copied by a scribe named Merodach-sum-iddin,
probably in the time of Nebuchadnezzar or his
successors, it is evident that some of the contents
of the library of Babylon escaped the destruction
brought upon that city by Sennacherib in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 692.</p>

<p>I may add that since the greater part of this
edition has been in type, I have found myself able
to explain the name of the hero which in default
of the true transcription has been provisionally
read Izdubar. The name is composed of three
ideographs, the first of which is the determinative
prefix of wood, while the two latter are rendered
<i>saptu saplitu</i>, “the lower lip,” in Semitic Assyrian.
Now M. Lenormant has shown that Izdubar was
originally the Accadian Fire-god, and Mr. Boscawen
has pointed out that the fire-stick was once used
in Babylonia; it is therefore evident that the three
ideographs composing the name represent the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
piece of wood, with a lip or groove in it, which
formed the most important part of the primitive
fire-machine. I believe the Accadian pronunciation
of the name will turn out to be Kibirra.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span> has long been known from the fragments
of the Chaldean historian, Berosus,
preserved in the works of various later
writers, that the Babylonians were acquainted
with traditions referring to the Creation,
the period before the Flood, the Deluge, and other
matters of which we read in the book of Genesis.</p>

<p>Berosus, however, who recorded these events, is
stated by Eusebius and Tatian to have been a contemporary
of Alexander the Great, and to have lived
into the reign of Antiochus Soter. His date lies,
therefore, between <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 330 and 260. As this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
three hundred years after the captivity of the Jews in
Babylon, the great antiquity of these traditions could
not be proved with certainty, much less their independence
of the accounts which we have in Genesis.</p>

<p>On the discovery and decipherment of the cuneiform
inscriptions, Oriental scholars hoped that copies
of the Babylonian histories and traditions would one
day be found, and that earlier and more satisfactory
evidence as to these primitive histories than had
previously been accessible, would thus be gained.</p>

<p>In the mound of Kouyunjik, opposite the town of
Mosul, Mr. Layard discovered part of the Royal
Assyrian library, and further collections, also forming
part of this library, have been subsequently found
by Mr. H. Rassam, Mr. Loftus, and Mr. George Smith.
Sir Henry Rawlinson, who made the preliminary
examination of Mr. Layard’s treasures, and was the
first to recognize their value, estimated the number
of fragments brought from this Library at over twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>The attention of decipherers was in the first instance
drawn to the later historical inscriptions, particularly
to those of the Assyrian kings contemporary
with the Hebrew monarchy; and in this department
of research a very large number of texts of great
importance rewarded the toil of Assyrian scholars.
Inscriptions of Tiglath Pileser, Shalmaneser, Sargon,
Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, Nabonidus,
and numerous other ancient sovereigns, bearing
directly on the Bible, and throwing new light upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
parts of ancient history previously obscure, for a long
time occupied almost exclusively the attention of
students, and overshadowed any work in other divisions
of Assyrian literature.</p>

<p>Although it was known that Assyria borrowed its
civilization and written characters from Babylonia,
yet, as the Assyrian nation was throughout the greater
part of its independent existence hostile to the southern
and older kingdom, it could not be guessed
beforehand that the peculiar national traditions of
Babylonia would have been transported to Assyria.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, for some years after
the cuneiform inscriptions were first deciphered,
nothing was looked for or discovered bearing upon
the events described in Genesis; but, as new texts
were brought into notice, it became evident that the
Assyrians borrowed their literature largely from
Babylonian sources, and it appeared likely that search
among the fragments of Assyrian inscriptions would
yield traces at least of some of these ancient Babylonian
legends.</p>

<p>Attention was early drawn to this fact by Sir
Henry Rawlinson, who pointed out several coincidences
between the geography of Babylonia and the
account of Eden in Genesis, and suggested the great
probability that the accounts in Genesis had a Babylonian
origin.</p>

<p>While preparing the fourth volume of Cuneiform
Inscriptions for the trustees of the British Museum,
Mr. George Smith noticed references to the Creation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
in a tablet numbered K 63 in the Museum collection,
as well as allusions in other tablets to similar legends;
he therefore searched through a series of tablets he
had previously classed as “Mythological,” in order to
find, if possible, some of these legends. This series
of mythological tablets was one of six into which he
had divided the Museum collection of cuneiform inscriptions
for convenience of working. By placing
all the tablets and fragments of the same class together,
he had been able to complete several texts, to find
easily any subject required, and to get, whenever it was
needed, a general idea of the contents of the collection.</p>

<p>The mythological division contained all the tablets
which related to Assyrian mythology, and all the
legends in which the gods took a leading part, together
with prayers and similar subjects.</p>

<p>A steady search among these fragments soon brought
to light half of a curious tablet which had evidently
contained originally six columns of text; two of these
(the third and fourth) were still nearly perfect; two
others (the second and fifth) were imperfect, about
half being lost, while the remaining columns (the
first and sixth) were entirely gone. A statement in
the third column that “the ship” had rested on the
mountain of Nizir, followed by an account of the
sending forth of a dove, and its finding no resting-place
and returning, convinced Mr. Smith that he had
discovered a portion at least of the Chaldean account
of the Deluge. He then proceeded to read through
the document, and found it was in the form of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
speech from the hero of the Deluge to a person
whose name might be transcribed as Izdubar. The
same name had already been read on the fragment of
another tablet numbered K 231, which turned out to
belong to the same series of tablets as the newly-found
account of the Deluge. Mr. Smith was thus encouraged
to make a search for other portions of the series.</p>

<p>The search was a long and heavy work, for there
were thousands of fragments to be examined, and
these were so small, and contained so little of the text,
that it was extremely difficult to ascertain their
meaning. The search, however, proved successful.
A fragment of another copy of the Deluge was found
containing a second account of the sending forth of
the birds. Several other portions of the same tablet
were gradually collected and fitted one after another
into their places until the greater part of the second
column was filled up. Portions of a third copy were
next discovered, which, when joined together, completed
a considerable part of the first and sixth
columns. Mr. Smith now translated the text he had
so laboriously pieced together, and published his
discovery to the world at a meeting of the Society of
Biblical Archæology, December 3rd, 1872. By this
time he had made out that the series of Izdubar
legends, as we may term them, contained twelve
tablets or books. Of this series the tablet describing
the Deluge was the eleventh and K 231 the sixth.</p>

<p>The interest excited by Mr. Smith’s discovery was
naturally very great. Immediately after the meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the Society of Biblical Archæology, Mr. E. Arnold,
in the name of the proprietors of the “Daily Telegraph,”
asked the fortunate discoverer to reopen, at
their cost, the excavations in Assyria in the hope of
finding the missing portions of the story of the Deluge.
The trustees of the British Museum granted Mr.
Smith leave of absence for the purpose, and he accordingly
started for the ruins of Nineveh, and there
engaged in researches, the history of which is related in
his work entitled “Assyrian Discoveries.” Hardly
had he begun his excavations on the site of the palace
of Assur-bani-pal at Kouyunjik, when he came across
a new fragment of the Chaldean account of the Deluge
belonging to the first column of the tablet, containing
the command to build and fill the ark, and nearly
filling up the most considerable blank in the story.
Some other fragments, found afterwards, still further
completed this tablet, which was already the most
perfect one in the Izdubar series. The trench in
which the fragment in question was discovered must
have passed very near the part of the Library in which
the Assyrians kept a series of inscriptions relating to
the early history of the world. The same trench soon
afterwards yielded a fragment of the sixth tablet,
describing the destruction of the bull of Istar by
Izdubar and Hea-bani, an incident often depicted on
early Babylonian gems. The next discovery was a
fragment which referred to the creation of the world;
it formed the upper corner of a tablet, and gave a
fragmentary account of the creation of animals. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
other portions of this legend were found further on in
the trench, one of which contained a mutilated account
of the war between the gods and evil spirits.</p>

<p>In the following year Mr. Smith was again in
Assyria, in charge of an expedition sent out by the
trustees of the British Museum, and succeeded in
bringing home fresh fragments relating to the early
traditions and legends of Babylonia. Among these
is the fragment which seems to describe the building
of the Tower of Babel. Then followed the disastrous
expedition of 1875-6, in the course of which Mr.
Smith fell a victim to over-fatigue and his zeal for
Assyrian research. The subsequent explorations of
Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, though rich in other results,
have added very little to our knowledge of the old
Babylonian legends; and it seems probable that the
missing portions of the tablets which contained them
have irretrievably perished. We must wait for
further light upon the subject until the cities and
libraries of Babylonia have been excavated. After
all, the early Babylonian legends, of which copies
were made for the Assyrian Library at Kouyunjik,
were but a selected few; the Assyrians took little
interest in that part of Babylonian literature which
had no connection with their own history or beliefs,
and we have reason to congratulate ourselves that
among the traditions they borrowed from their older
and more civilized neighbours were so many which
bear upon the earlier chapters of Genesis.</p>

<p>The fragmentary condition of the legends we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
possess, however, is much to be lamented. The
chief difficulties with which the Assyrian scholar has
to contend, when dealing with them, are due to the
mutilated state of the tablets. If the inscriptions
were perfect, their translation would be a comparatively
easy matter. As it is, so skilled a decipherer
as Mr. Smith himself was deceived by the defective
character of the text into imagining that a hymn
addressed to the Creator was the Babylonian version
of the Fall of Man.</p>

<p>The fragmentary and scattered character of these
legends is explained by the nature of the material of
which the tablets are composed, and the changes
undergone by them since they were written. They
consist of fine clay and were inscribed with cuneiform
characters while in a soft state; they were then
baked in a furnace until hard, and afterwards transferred
to the library. The library seems to have
been in an upper storey of the palace, and after the
destruction of Nineveh, the fall of the building in
which it was placed naturally caused the tablets contained
in it to be broken to pieces. Many of them
were cracked and scorched by the heat of the burning
ruins. Subsequently the ruins were turned over in
search of treasure, and the tablets still further
broken; while, to complete their destruction, the
rain, soaking through the ground every spring,
saturates them with water containing chemicals, and
these chemicals form crystals in every available
crack. The growth of the crystals further splits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the tablets, some of them being literally shivered
to pieces.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Reverse of Inscribed Terra Cotta Tablet containing the Account

</div>

<p>Some idea of the mutilated condition of the Assyrian
tablets, and of the work required by the restoration
of a single text, will be gained from the engraving
above, which exhibits the appearance of one of
the Deluge tablets at the time Mr. Smith published
his translation of it. In this tablet there are no less
than sixteen fragments.</p>

<p>The clay records of the Assyrians are by these
means so broken up, that a single text is in some
cases divided into over one hundred fragments; and
it is only by collecting and joining these together
that the old texts can be restored. Many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
fragmentary tablets which have been more than
twenty years in the British Museum have been
added to considerably by the fragments recently
brought to England by Mr. Smith and Mr. Rassam;
and yet there probably remain from ten to twenty
thousand fragments still buried in the ruins, without
the recovery of which it is impossible to complete
these valuable Assyrian inscriptions.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, out of these imperfect materials
that we have at present to piece together our knowledge
of the early legends of Babylonia and Assyria.
Most, if not all, of them, are, it must be remembered,
of Chaldean or Babylonian origin, the Assyrians
having either slavishly copied Babylonian originals
or simply put into a new form the story they had
borrowed from their southern neighbours. Such as
they are, however, they are presented to the reader
as faithfully translated as our existing knowledge of
the Assyrian language allows; it is for him to draw
his inferences and make his comparisons. The greater
number of them, as we shall see, mount back to a
date earlier than the second millennium before the
Christian era, and even where the actual text belongs
to a later period, the legend which it embodies claims
a similar antiquity. We may classify them in the
following order:—</p>

<p>1. An account of the Creation of the world in six
days, parallel to that in the first chapter of Genesis,
and probably in its present form not older than the
7th century <span class="smcap">B.C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></span></p>

<p>2. A second account of the Creation, derived from
the Library of Cuthah, and belonging to the oldest
period of Babylonian literature.</p>

<p>3. A history of the conflict between Merodach, the
champion of the gods, and Tiamat, “the Deep,” the
representative of chaos and evil. To this we may
add the bilingual legend of the seven evil spirits and
their fight against the moon.</p>

<p>4. The story of the descent of the goddess Istar or
Venus into Hades, and her return.</p>

<p>5. The legend of the sin of the god Zu, punished
by Bel, the father of the gods.</p>

<p>6. A collection of five tablets giving the exploits
of Dibbara the god of the pestilence.</p>

<p>7. The story of the wise man who put forth a
riddle to the gods.</p>

<p>8. The legend of the good man Atarpi, and the
wickedness of the world.</p>

<p>9. The legend of the tower of Babel, and dispersion.</p>

<p>10. The story of the Eagle and Etana.</p>

<p>11. The story of the ox and the horse.</p>

<p>12. The story of the fox.</p>

<p>13. The legend of Sinuri.</p>

<p>14. The Izdubar legends: twelve tablets, with the
history of Izdubar, and an account of the flood.</p>

<p>15. The story of the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah. Besides these there are fragments of
other legends, which show that there was a considerable
collection of such primitive stories still quite
unknown to us. In fact we have little chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
becoming acquainted with them until the libraries of
Babylonia are excavated. Thus for example we
learn from Berosus that the Babylonians ascribed
their civilization to certain wonderful creatures who
ascended out of the Persian Gulf, and more especially
to a being called Oannes. But of all this the library
of Nineveh tells us nothing, although an Accadian
Reading-book compiled for Assyrian students contains
an excerpt which seems to be taken from the
legend of Oannes. It is as follows:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. To the waters their god</li>
<li>2. had returned.</li>
<li>3. To the glistening house</li>
<li>4. he descended (as) an icicle.</li>
<li>5. (On) a seat of snow</li>
<li>6. he grew not old in wisdom.</li>
<li>7. The wise people</li>
<li>8. with his wisdom he filled.</li>
</ul>


<p>Two fragments, belonging to two editions of the
same text, have just been found, containing a list of
the numerous legends and epics current among the
ancient Babylonians, along with the names of their
authors. Among them are found several of which
translations are given further on in this volume; but
there are also several of which we hear for the first
time. The great Izdubar Epic, it may be noted, is
ascribed to a certain Sin-lici-unnini (“O Moon-god,
receive my cry!”). A fuller account of the fragments
and their contents will be found in the Introduction.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> order to understand the position to
which we must assign the legends of
early Chaldea, it is necessary to give
some account of the literature of the
Ancient Babylonians and their copyists, the Assyrians.
As has been already stated, the fragments of burnt
brick on which these legends are inscribed were found
in the débris which covers the palaces called the
South West Palace and the North Palace at Kouyunjik;
the former building being of the age of
Sennacherib, the latter belonging to the time of
Assur-bani-pal. The tablets, which are of all sizes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
from one inch long to over a foot square, are generally
in fragments, and in consequence of the changes
which have taken place in the ruins the fragments of
the same tablet are sometimes scattered widely apart.
They were originally deposited, it would seem, in
one of the upper chambers of the palace, from which
they fell on the destruction of the building. In some
of the lower chambers the whole floor has been found
covered with them, in other cases they lay in groups
or patches on the pavement, and there are occasional
clusters of fragments at various heights in the earth
which covers the ruins. Other fragments are scattered
singly through all the upper earth which covers
the floors and walls of the palace. Different fragments
of the same tablet or cylinder are found in
separate chambers which have no immediate connection
with each other, showing that their present
distribution has nothing to do with the original
position of the tablets of which they formed
part.</p>

<p>The inscriptions show that the tablets were arranged
according to their subjects. Stories or subjects
were continued on other tablets of the same
size and form as those on which they were commenced,
in some cases the number of tablets in a
series and on a single subject amounting to over
one hundred.</p>

<p>Each subject or series of tablets had a title, the
title consisting of the first phrase or part of a phrase
in it. Thus, the series of Astrological tablets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
numbering over seventy tablets, bore the title “When
the gods Anu (and) Bel,” this being the commencement
of the first tablet. At the end of every tablet
in each series was written its number in the work,
thus: “the first tablet of When the gods Anu, Bel,”
“the second tablet of When the gods Anu, Bel,”
&amp;c. &amp;c.; and, further to preserve the proper position
of each tablet, every one except the last in a series
had at the end a catch phrase, consisting of the first
line of the following tablet. There were besides,
catalogues of these documents written like them on
clay tablets, and other small oval tablets with titles
upon them, apparently labels for the various series of
works. All these arrangements show the care taken
with respect to literary matters. There were regular
libraries or chambers, probably on the upper floors of
the palaces, appointed for the reception of the tablets,
and custodians or librarians to take charge of them.
These regulations were all of great antiquity, and
like the tablets had a Babylonian origin.</p>

<p>Judging from the fragments discovered, it appears
probable that there were in the Royal Library at
Nineveh over 10,000 inscribed tablets, treating of
almost every branch of knowledge existing at the
time.</p>

<p>In considering a subject like the present one it is
a point of the utmost importance to define as closely
as possible the date of our present copies of the
legends, and the most probable period at which the
original copies may have been inscribed. By far the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
greatest number of the tablets brought from Nineveh
belong to the age of Assur-bani-pal, who reigned over
Assyria from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 670, and every copy of what we
will term the Genesis legends yet found was inscribed
with one exception during his reign. The statements
made on the tablets themselves are conclusive
on this point, and have not been called in question,
but it is equally stated and acknowledged on all
hands that most of these tablets are not the originals,
but are only copies from earlier texts. It is unfortunate
that the date of the original copies is never preserved,
and thus a wide door is thrown open for
difference of opinion on the point. The Assyrians acknowledged
that this class of literature was borrowed
from Babylonian sources, and of course it is to Babylonia
that we have to look to ascertain the approximate
dates of the original documents. But here we
are met by the following difficulty. It appears that
at an early period in Babylonian history a great
literary development took place, and numerous works
were produced which embodied the prevailing myths,
religion, and science of the day. Written many of
them in a noble style of poetry, and appealing to the
strongest feelings of the people on one side, or registering
the highest efforts of their science on the
other, these texts became the standards of Babylonian
literature, and later generations were content
to copy them instead of composing new works for
themselves. Clay, the material on which they were
written, was everywhere abundant, copies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
multiplied, and the veneration in which the texts
were held fixed and stereotyped their style. Even
the language in which they were written remained
the language of literature up to the period of the
Persian conquest. Thus it happens that texts of
Rim-agu, Sargon, and Khammuragas, who lived at
least a thousand years before Nebuchadnezzar and
Nabonidus, are composed in the same language as the
texts of these later kings, there being no sensible difference
in style to match the long interval between them.</p>

<p>We have, however, clear proof that, although
the language of devotion and literature remained
fixed, the speech of the bulk of the people was
gradually modified; and in the time of Assur-bani-pal,
when the texts of the Genesis legends
which we possess were copied by Assyrian scribes,
the common speech of the day was widely different
from that of literature. The private letters and
despatches of this age which have been discovered
differ considerably in language from the contemporary
public documents and religious writings,
showing the change the language had undergone
since the style of the latter had been fixed. So,
too, in our own country the language of devotion and
the style of the Bible differ in several respects from
those of the English of to-day.</p>

<p>These considerations show the difficulty of fixing
the age of a cuneiform document from its style, and
the difficulty is further increased by the uncertainty
which hangs over all Babylonian chronology—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
uncertainty that can be cleared away only when the
ruined cities of Babylonia are excavated.</p>

<p>Chronology is always a thorny subject, and dry
and unsatisfactory to most persons besides; some
notice must, however, be taken of it here, in order to
fix something like an approximate date or epoch for
the original composition of the Genesis legends.</p>

<p>The so-called Assyrian Canon affords us an exact
chronology up to the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 909, and a series
of contemporaneous monuments, together with one
or two chronological allusions in later inscriptions,
enables us to work back from this date to a period
falling between <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1450 and 1400 when Assyria
was brought into close relation with the southern
kingdom of Babylonia. Babylonia was at the time
under the sway of a foreign dynasty of Kossæan
princes from the mountains of Elam, which was overthrown,
as we learn from the Assyrian records, about
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1270. It had been in possession of the country
for a considerable time, since a fragmentary list
which gives the names of the first nine sovereigns
composing it does not come down to the time when
the first of the princes who came into close contact
with Assyria was reigning. Indeed, a considerable
interval must be allowed between the latter period
and the last of the nine kings mentioned in the list,
in which to insert the isolated names of more than
one monarch of the dynasty incidentally mentioned
on later monuments. Supposing that not more than
fifteen kings preceded Cara-indas in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1450, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
that the average length of their reigns was twenty
years, we should have <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1750 as the approximate
date of the leader of the dynasty. He could not have
been later than this, and there are many reasons
which would lead us to suppose that he was earlier.</p>

<p>Khammuragas was the leader of the dynasty in
question. He had conquered the rulers of the two
kingdoms into which Babylonia was at this time
divided. One of these was a queen, with whom
ended a dynasty, famous in the annals of early Babylonia,
whose seat was at Agané or Agadé, near Sepharvaim.
She had been the successor of Naram-Sin,
the son of Sargon, who, like his father, had extended
his power far and wide, and had even penetrated as
far as the shores of the Mediterranean. Sargon had
been a great patron of learning as well as a conqueror;
he had established a famous library at
Agané, and had caused a work on astronomy and
astrology to be compiled, which remained the standard
authority on the subject up to the end of the Assyrian
Empire. It was entitled, “The Illumination of Bel,”
and was in seventy-two books. Berosus, the historian,
seems to have translated it into Greek.</p>

<p>Like the Babylonians and Assyrians of a later
day, Sargon and his subjects belonged to the Semitic
stock, and were therefore related to the Hebrews
and the Arabians. But they were really intruders
in Chaldea. The primitive inhabitants of the country,
the builders of its cities, the inventors of the
cuneiform system of writing, and the founders of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
culture and civilization which was afterwards borrowed
by the Semites, were of a wholly different race.
They spoke an agglutinative language of the same
character as that of the modern Turks or Finns, and
were originally divided into two sections—the inhabitants
of Sumir or Shinar, the plain country, and the
Accadians or “Highlanders,” who had descended
from the mountains of Elam subsequently to the
first settlement of their kinsfolk in Shinar. At some
date between <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 3000 and 2000, the Semitic population
which bordered upon Babylonia on the west,
and had long been settled in some of its western
cities, such as Ur (now Mugheir), conquered Shinar
or Sumir. The Accadians, however, maintained
their independence for a considerable time after this
conquest, until, finally, Accad also was reduced
under the sway of the Semitic kings. The old
population of the country was gradually absorbed,
and its language became extinct. The extinction of
the Accadian or Sumerian language had already taken
place—at all events among the educated classes—at
the time that Sargon founded his library at Agané,
and one of the chief reasons which led to the compilation
of the great work on astronomy, was the necessity
of preserving the astronomical and astrological
observations recorded in a language which was beginning
to be forgotten. At the same time Semitic
translations of other portions of the old Accadian
literature were made. The library at Agané, however,
was not the only place where the work of trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>lation
went on; many other libraries existed, and
their scribes and readers had alike become Semites,
who required works written in their own tongue.
The Semitic translations of Accadian works which
were made for the library of Erech, one of the earliest
seats of Semitic power, must have been considerably
older than those made for the library of Sargon.</p>

<p>The extinction of the Accadian language and the
translation of Accadian works into Semitic Babylonian
are important facts for settling the chronology of a
document or inscription. Wherever we can show
that a Babylonian or Assyrian text is translated
from an Accadian original, or wherever we have a
copy of that original itself, we may feel pretty sure
that we are dealing with something older than the
eighteenth century before the Christian era.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith believed that the “Exploits of the God
Dibbara” was one of the oldest of the mythological
texts which have come down to us, though he admitted
that the mention of Assyria in it was in favour of a
somewhat later date.</p>

<p>It notices a large number of peoples or states, the
principal being the people of the coast, Subartu or
Syria, Assyria, Elam, the Kassi, the Sutu, Goim,
Lullubu, and Accad.</p>

<p>The Izdubar legends, containing the story of the
Flood, and possibly also the history of Nimrod, were
probably written in the south of the country, and at
least as early as <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2000. These legends were,
however, traditions before they were committed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
writing, and were common in some form to the whole
of Chaldea.</p>

<p>The account of the Creation in days, though probably
of late Assyrian origin in its present form, may
nevertheless rest on older traditions. At present,
however, it is not possible to assign to it any great
antiquity.</p>

<p>It should, of course, be remembered, that the texts
we possess at present are written in Semitic Babylonian
or Assyrian—Babylonian and Assyrian being
but slightly varying dialects of the same language.
They are, however, mostly translations of earlier
Accadian documents, and belong to the same period
as that which witnessed the foundation of the library
of Agané. We shall not be far wrong, therefore, in
dating them in their present form about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2000.
The translations then made were copied by successive
generations of librarians and scribes, the latest copies
of which we know being those that have been brought
from the library of Kouyunjik.</p>

<p>To the same early period belonged various other
literary compositions, among which we may particularize
a long work on terrestrial omens, compiled for
Sargon of Agané, as well as the syllabaries, grammars,
phrase-books and vocabularies, and other bilingual
tablets by means of which a knowledge of the
old language of Accad was conveyed to the Babylonian
or Assyrian scholar.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a series of tablets on evil
spirits, which contained a totally different tradition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the Creation from that in days, goes back to the
Accadian epoch; and there is a third account from
the City of Cutha, closely agreeing in some respects
with the account handed down by Berosus, which
must be placed about the same date.</p>

<p>In spite of the indications as to peculiarities of
worship, names of states and capitals, historical allusions
and other evidence, it may seem hazardous to
many persons to fix the dates of original documents
so high, when our only copies in many cases are
Assyrian transcripts made in the reign of Assur-bani-pal,
in the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; but one or two
considerations may show that this is a perfectly reasonable
view, and no other likely period can be found
for the original composition of the documents unless
we ascend to a greater antiquity. In the first place,
it must be noticed that the Assyrians themselves state
that the documents were copied from ancient Babylonian
copies, and in some cases state that the old
copies were partly illegible even in their day. Again,
in more than one case there is actual proof of the
antiquity of a text. We may refer, for example, to
a text an Assyrian copy of part of which is published
in “Cuneiform Inscriptions,” vol. ii. plate 54, Nos.
3 &amp; 4. In a collection of tablets discovered by Mr.
Loftus at Senkereh, belonging, according to the
kings mentioned in it, to about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1600, is part of
an ancient Babylonian copy of this very text, the
Babylonian copy being about one thousand years
older than the Assyrian one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>Similarly a fragment of a Babylonian transcript of
the Deluge tablet has recently been brought from
Babylonia, and serves not only to fill up some of the
breaks in our Assyrian copies, but also to verify the
text of the latter.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that so many of the documents
embodying the Genesis traditions are in such a sadly
mutilated condition, but there can be no doubt that
future explorations will reveal more perfect copies,
and numerous companion and explanatory texts,
which will one day clear up the difficulties which
now meet us at every step of our examination of
them.</p>

<p>So far as known contemporary inscriptions are
concerned, we cannot consider our present researches
and discoveries as anything like sufficient to give a
fair view of the literature of Assyria and Babylonia;
and however numerous and important the Genesis
legends may be, they form but a small portion of the
whole literature of the country.</p>

<p>It is generally considered that the earliest inscriptions
of any importance which we now possess belong
to the time of Lig-Bagas, king of Ur, who first
united under his sway the petty kingdoms into
which Chaldea was previously split up, and whose
age is generally assigned to about three thousand
years before the Christian era.</p>

<p>The principal inscriptions of this period consist of
texts on bricks and on signet cylinders, and some of
the latter may be of much greater antiquity. Passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
down to a time when the country was again divided
into the kingdoms of Karrak, Larsa, and Agané, we
find a great accession of literary material, almost
every class of writing being represented by contemporary
specimens. Each of the principal cities
had its library, and education seems to have been
widely diffused. From Senkereh, the ancient Larsa,
and its neighbourhood have come our oldest specimens
of these literary tablets, the following being
some of the contents of this earliest known library:—</p>

<p>1. Mythological tablets, including lists of the gods,
and their manifestations and titles.</p>

<p>2. Grammatical works, lists of words, and explanations.</p>

<p>3. Mathematical works, calculations, tables of cube
and square roots, and tables of measures.</p>

<p>4. Works on astronomy, astrology, and omens.</p>

<p>5. Legends and short historical inscriptions.</p>

<p>6. Historical cylinders, one of Kudur-mabuk, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
1800 (?) (the earliest known cylinder), being in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>7. Geographical tablets, and lists of towns and
countries.</p>

<p>8. Tablets containing laws and law cases, records
of sale and barter, wills and loans.</p>

<p>Such are the inscriptions a single library of
Babylonia has produced, and beside these there
are numerous texts, only known to us through later
copies, but which certainly had their origin as early
as this period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Passing down from this period, for some centuries
we find only detached inscriptions, accompanied by
evidence of the gradual shifting of both political
power and literary activity from Babylonia to
Assyria.</p>

<p>In Assyria the first centre of literature and seat
of a library was the city of Assur (Kileh Shergat),
and the earliest known tablets date about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1500.</p>

<p>Beyond the scanty records of a few monarchs
nothing of value remains of this library, and the
literary works contained in it are only known from
later copies.</p>

<p>A revival of the Assyrian empire began under
Assur-natsir-pal, king of Assyria, who ascended the
throne <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 885. He rebuilt the city of Calah (Nimroud),
and this city became the seat of an Assyrian
library. Tablets were procured from Babylonia by
Shalmaneser, son of Assur-natsir-pal, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 860, during
the reign of Nabu-bal-idina, king of Babylon, and
these were copied by the Assyrian scribes, and
placed in the royal library. Rimmon-nirari, grandson
of Shalmaneser, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 812, added to the Calah
library, and had tablets written at Nineveh. Assur-nirari,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 755, continued the literary work, some
mythological tablets being dated in his reign.</p>

<p>Tiglath Pileser, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 745, enlarged the library, and
placed in it various copies of historical inscriptions.
It was, however, reserved for Sargon, who founded
the last Assyrian dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 721, to make the
Assyrian royal library worthy of the empire. Early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
in his reign he appointed Nabu-zuqub-cinu principal
librarian, and this officer set to work to make new
copies of all the standard works of the day. During
the whole of his term of office copies of the great
literary works were produced, the majority of the
texts preserved belonging to the early period previous
to Khammuragas.</p>

<p>With the accession of Sargon came a revival of
literature in Assyria; education became more general,
ancient texts were brought from Babylonia to be
copied, and the antiquarian study of early literature
became fashionable.</p>

<p>Sennacherib, son of Sargon, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 704, continued to
add to his father’s library at Calah, but late in his
reign he removed the collection from that city to
Nineveh (Kouyunjik), where from this time forth
the national library remained until the fall of the
empire.</p>

<p>Esarhaddon, son of Sennacherib, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 681, further
increased the national collection, most of the works
he added being of a religious character.</p>

<p>Assur-bani-pal, son of Esarhaddon, the Sardanapalus
of the Greeks, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 670, was the greatest of the
Assyrian sovereigns, and he is far more memorable
on account of his magnificent patronage of learning
than on account of the greatness of his empire or the
extent of his wars.</p>

<p>Assur-bani-pal added more to the Assyrian royal
library than all the kings who had gone before him,
and it is to tablets written in his reign that we owe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
almost all our knowledge of the Babylonian myths
and early history, beside many other important
matters.</p>

<p>The agents of Assur-bani-pal sought everywhere
for inscribed tablets, brought them to Nineveh, and
copied them there; thus the literary treasures of
Babylon, Borsippa, Cutha, Agané, Ur, Erech, Larsa,
Nipur, and various other cities were transferred to the
Assyrian capital to enrich the great collection there.</p>

<p>The fragments brought over to Europe give us
a good idea of this library and show the range of
the subjects embraced by its collection of works.
Among the different classes of texts, the Genesis
stories and similar legends occupied a prominent
place; these, as they will be further described in the
present volume, need only be mentioned here. Accompanying
them we have a series of mythological
tablets of various sorts, varying from legends of the
gods, psalms, songs, prayers, and hymns, down to
mere allusions and lists of names. Many of these
texts take the form of charms to be used in sickness
and for the expulsion of evil spirits; some of them
are of great antiquity, being older than the Izdubar
legends. One fine series deals with remedies against
witchcraft and the assaults of evil spirits. Izdubar is
mentioned in one of these tablets as lord of the oaths
or pledges of the world.</p>

<p>Some of the prayers were for use on special occasions,
such as on starting on a campaign, on the
occurrence of an eclipse, &amp;c. Astronomy and astro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>logy
were represented by various detached inscriptions
and reports, but principally by the great work
of which mention has already been made, and many
copies of which were in the Library of Assur-bani-pal.</p>

<p>Among the Astrological tablets is a fragment
which professes to be copied from an original of the
time of Izdubar.</p>

<p>Historical texts formed another section of the
library, and these included numerous copies of inscriptions
of early Babylonian kings; there were
besides, chronological tablets with lists of kings and
annual officers, inscriptions of various Assyrian
monarchs, histories of the relations between Assyria
and Babylonia, Elam, and Arabia, treaties, despatches,
proclamations, and reports on the state of
the empire and military affairs.</p>

<p>Natural history was represented by bilingual lists
of mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, and plants,
trees, grasses, reeds, and grains, earths, stones, &amp;c.
These lists are classified according to the supposed
nature and affinities of the various species, and show
considerable advance in the sciences. Mathematics
had a place in the library, there being tables of problems,
figures, and calculations; but this branch of
learning was not studied so fully as in Babylonia.</p>

<p>Grammar and Lexicography were better represented,
since there were many works on these subjects,
including lists of the characters, the declension
of the noun, the conjugation of the verb, examples of
syntactical construction, reading-books, interlinear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
translations of Accadian texts, and the like. All
these tablets were copied from Babylonian originals.
In legal and civil literature the library was also rich,
and the tablets serve to show that the same laws and
customs prevailed in Assyria as in Babylonia. There
are codes of laws, law cases, records of sale, barter,
and loans, lists of property, lists of titles and trades,
of tribute and taxes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Geography the Assyrians were not very advanced;
but there are lists of countries and their
productions, of cities, rivers, mountains, and peoples.</p>

<p>Such are some of the principal contents of the
great library from which we have obtained our copies
of the Creation and Flood legends. Most of the
tablets were copied from early Babylonian ones which
have in most cases disappeared; but the copies are
sufficient to show the wonderful progress in culture
and civilization already made by the people of Chaldea
long before the age of Moses or even Abraham.
Babylonian literature, which had been the parent of
Assyrian writing, revived after the fall of Nineveh,
and Nebuchadnezzar and his successors made Babylon
the seat of a library rivalling that of Assur-bani-pal at
Nineveh. Of this later development of Babylonian
literature we know very little, explorations being still
required to bring to light its texts. A few fragments
only, discovered by wandering Arabs or recovered by
chance travellers, have as yet turned up, but there is
in them evidence enough to promise a rich reward to
future excavators.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">By</span> way of introduction to the native versions
of the early legends left us by the
Babylonians, it is advisable to glance at
the principal fragments bearing on them
which are found in the classical writers of Greece and
Rome. Several others might have been quoted, but
their origin is doubtful, and they are of less importance
for the subject in hand. Those who wish to consult
them may turn to Cory’s “Ancient Fragments”
(2nd edition, 1876), whose translations, as being
fairly scholarlike and correct, are here given without
alteration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>Berosus, from whom the principal extracts are
copied, lived, as has already been stated, about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
330 to 260, and, from his position as a Babylonian
priest, had the best means of knowing the Babylonian
traditions.</p>

<p>The others are later writers, who copied in the
main from Berosus, most of whose notices may be
taken as mere abridgments of his statements.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Extract I. from Alexander Polyhistor</span><br />

<small>(<span class="smcap">Cory</span>, p. 56).</small></h3>

<p>Berosus, in the first book of his history of Babylonia,
informs us that he lived in the age of Alexander,
the son of Philip. And he mentions that there
were written accounts, preserved at Babylon with
the greatest care, comprehending a period of above
fifteen myriads of years; and that these writings
contained histories of the heaven and of the sea; of
the birth of mankind; and of the kings, and of the
memorable actions which they had achieved.</p>

<p>And in the first place he describes Babylonia as a
country situated between the Tigris and the Euphrates;
that it abounded with wheat, and barley,
and ocrus, and sesame; and that in the lakes were
found the roots called gongæ, which are fit for food,
and in respect to nutriment similar to barley. There
were also palm-trees and apples, and a variety of
fruits; fish also and birds, both those which are
merely of flight, and those which frequent the water.
Those parts of the country which bordered upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Arabia were without water, and barren; but that
which lay on the other side was both hilly and fertile.</p>

<p>At Babylon there was (in these times) a great
resort of people of various races, who inhabited
Chaldea, and lived in a lawless manner like the
beasts of the field.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Oannes and other Babylonian Mythological Figures
from Cylinder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the first year there appeared, from that part of
the Erythræan sea which borders upon Babylonia,
an animal endowed with reason, by name Oannes,
whose whole body (according to the account of
Apollodorus) was that of a fish; under the fish’s
head he had another head, with feet also below
similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish’s
tail. His voice, too, and language were articulate
and human; and a representation of him is preserved
even to this day.</p>

<p>This being was accustomed to pass the day among
men, but took no food at that season; and he gave
them an insight into letters and sciences, and arts of
every kind. He taught them to construct houses, to
found temples, to compile laws, and explained to
them the principles of geometrical knowledge. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and
showed them how to collect the fruits; in short, he
instructed them in every thing which could tend to
soften manners and humanize their lives. From that
time, nothing material has been added by way of
improvement to his instructions. And when the
sun had set this being Oannes used to retire again
into the sea, and pass the night in the deep, for he was
amphibious. After this there appeared other animals
like Oannes, of which Berosus proposes to give an
account when he comes to the history of the kings.
Moreover, Oannes wrote concerning the generation
of mankind, of their different ways of life, and of their
civil polity; and the following is the purport of what
he said:—</p>

<p>“There was a time in which there existed nothing
but darkness and an abyss of waters, wherein
resided most hideous beings, which were produced
of a two-fold principle. There appeared men, some
of whom were furnished with two wings, others with
four, and with two faces. They had one body, but
two heads; the one that of a man, the other of a
woman; they were likewise in their several organs
both male and female. Other human figures were to
be seen with the legs and horns of a goat; some had
horses’ feet, while others united the hind quarters
of a horse with the body of a man, resembling in
shape the hippocentaurs. Bulls likewise were bred
there with the heads of men; and dogs with fourfold
bodies, terminated in their extremities with the tails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of fishes; horses also with the heads of dogs; men,
too, and other animals, with the heads and bodies of
horses, and the tails of fishes. In short, there were
creatures in which were combined the limbs of every
species of animals. In addition to these, fishes,
reptiles, serpents, with other monstrous animals,
which assumed each other’s shape and countenance.
Of all which were preserved delineations in the
temple of Belus at Babylon.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Composite Animals from Cylinder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>“The person who was supposed to have presided
over them was a woman named Omoroka, which in
the Chaldean language is Thalatth; which in Greek
is interpreted Thalassa, the sea; but according to
the most true interpretation it is equivalent to Selene
the moon. All things being in this situation,
Belus came, and cut the woman asunder, and of one
half of her he formed the earth, and of the other
half the heavens, and at the same time destroyed the
animals within her (or in the abyss).</p>

<p>“All this” (he says)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> “was an allegorical description
of nature. For, the whole universe consisting
of moisture, and animals being continually generated
therein, the deity above-mentioned (Belus) cut off
his own head; upon which the other gods mixed the
blood, as it gushed out, with the earth, and from
thence men were formed. On this account it is that
they are rational, and partake of divine knowledge.
This Belus, by whom they signify Hades (Pluto),
divided the darkness, and separated the heavens from
the earth, and reduced the universe to order. But
the recently-created animals, not being able to bear
the prevalence of light, died. Belus upon this,
seeing a vast space unoccupied, though by nature
fruitful, commanded one of the gods to take off his
head, and to mix the blood with the earth, and from
thence to form other men and animals, which should
be capable of bearing the light. Belus formed also
the stars, and the sun, and the moon, and the five
planets.” (Such, according to Alexander Polyhistor,
is the account which Berosus gives in his first book.)</p>

<p>(In the second book was contained the history of
the ten kings of the Chaldeans, and the periods of
the continuance of each reign, which consisted collectively
of an hundred and twenty sari, or four
hundred and thirty-two thousand years; reaching to
the time of the Deluge. For Alexander, enumerating
the kings from the writings of the Chaldeans, after
the ninth, Ardates, proceeds to the tenth, who is
called by them Xisuthrus, in this manner):—</p>

<p>“After the death of Ardates, his son Xisuthrus
reigned eighteen sari. In his time happened the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
deluge; the history of which is thus described. The
deity Kronos appeared to him in a vision, and
warned him that upon the fifteenth day of the
month Dæsius there would be a flood, by which
mankind would be destroyed. He therefore enjoined
him to write a history of the beginning, progress,
and conclusion of all things, down to the present
term, and to bury it in Sippara, the city of the Sun;
and to build a vessel, and take with him into it his
friends and relations; and to convey on board every
thing necessary to sustain life, together with all the
different animals, both birds and quadrupeds, and
trust himself fearlessly to the deep. Having asked
the Deity whither he was to sail, he was answered,
‘To the Gods;’ upon which he offered up a prayer
for the good of mankind. He then obeyed the divine
admonition, and built a vessel five stadia in length,
and two in breadth. Into this he put everything
which he had prepared, and last of all conveyed into
it his wife, his children, and his friends.</p>

<p>After the flood had been upon the earth, and was
in time abated, Xisuthrus sent out birds from the
vessel; which not finding any food, nor any place
whereupon they might rest their feet, returned to
him again. After an interval of some days, he sent
them forth a second time; and they now returned
with their feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a
third time with these birds; but they returned to
him no more: from whence he judged that the surface
of the earth had appeared above the waters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
He therefore made an opening in the vessel, and
upon looking out found that it was stranded upon
the side of some mountain; upon which he immediately
quitted it with his wife, his daughter, and the
pilot. Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to the
earth: and, having constructed an altar, offered
sacrifices to the gods, and, with those who had come
out of the vessel with him, disappeared.</p>

<p>They who remained within, finding that their
companions did not return, quitted the vessel with
many lamentations, and called continually on the
name of Xisuthrus. Him they saw no more; but
they could distinguish his voice in the air, and could
hear him admonish them to pay due regard to the
gods; and he likewise informed them that it was
upon account of his piety that he was translated to
live with the gods, and that his wife and daughter and
the pilot had obtained the same honour. To this he
added that they should return to Babylonia, and,
as it was ordained, search for the writings at Sippara,
which they were to make known to all mankind;
moreover, that the place wherein they then
were was the land of Armenia. The rest having
heard these words offered sacrifices to the gods, and,
taking a circuit, journeyed towards Babylonia.</p>

<p>The vessel being thus stranded in Armenia, some
part of it yet remains in the Gordyæan (or Kurdish)
mountains in Armenia, and the people scrape off the
bitumen with which it had been outwardly coated,
and make use of it by way of an antidote and amulet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
In this manner they returned to Babylon and when
they had found the writings at Sippara they built
cities and erected temples, and Babylon was thus
inhabited again.”—<i>Syncel. Chron.</i> xxviii.; <i>Euseb.
Chron.</i> v. 8.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Berosus, from Apollodorus</span> (<span class="smcap">Cory</span>, p. 51).</h3>

<p>This is the history which Berosus has transmitted
to us. He tells us that the first king was Alorus of
Babylon, a Chaldean; he reigned ten sari (36,000
years); and afterwards Alaparus and Amelon, who
came from Pantibiblon; then Ammenon the Chaldean,
in whose time appeared the Musarus Oannes,
the Annedotus from the Erythræan sea. (But
Alexander Polyhistor, anticipating the event, has
said that he appeared in the first year, but Apollodorus
says that it was after forty sari; Abydenus,
however, makes the second Annedotus appear after
twenty-six sari.) Then succeeded Megalarus from
the city of Pantibiblon, and he reigned eighteen sari;
and after him Daonus, the shepherd from Pantibiblon,
reigned ten sari; in his time (he says)
appeared again from the Erythræan sea a fourth
Annedotus, having the same form with those above,
the shape of a fish blended with that of a man. Then
reigned Euedorachus (or Euedoreschus) from Pantibiblon
for the term of eighteen sari; in his days there
appeared another personage from the Erythræan
sea like the former, having the same complicated
form between a fish and a man, whose name was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Odakon. (All these, says Apollodorus, related
particularly and circumstantially whatever Oannes
had informed them of; concerning these Abydenus
has made no mention.) Then reigned Amempsinus,
a Chaldean from Larancha; and he being the eighth
in order reigned ten sari. Then reigned Otiartes,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> a
Chaldean, from Larancha; and he ruled eight sari.
And, upon the death of Otiartes, his son Xisuthrus
reigned eighteen sari; in his time happened the great
Deluge. So that the sum of all the kings is ten; and
the term which they collectively reigned an hundred
and twenty sari.—<i>Syncel. Chron.</i> xxxix.; <i>Euseb.
Chron.</i> v.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Berosus, from Abydenus</span> (<span class="smcap">Cory</span>, p. 53).</h3>

<p>So much concerning the wisdom of the Chaldeans.</p>

<p>It is said that the first king of the country was
Alorus, and that he gave out a report that God had
appointed him to be the shepherd<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of the people; he
reigned ten sari; now a sarus is esteemed to be three
thousand six hundred years, a neros six hundred,
and a sossus sixty.</p>

<p>After him Alaparus reigned three sari; to him
succeeded Amillarus from the city of Pantibiblon, who
reigned thirteen sari; in his time there came up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the sea a second Annedotus, a demigod very similar
in form to Oannes; after Amillarus reigned Ammenon
twelve sari; who was of the city of Pantibiblon;
then Megalarus of the same place reigned
eighteen sari; then Daos the shepherd governed for
the space of ten sari, he was of Pantibiblon; in his
time four double-shaped personages came up out
of the sea to land, whose names were Euedokus,
Eneugamus, Eneubulus, and Anementus; afterwards
in the time of Euedoreschus appeared another,
Anodaphus. After these reigned other kings, and
last of all Sisithrus, so that in all the number
amounted to ten kings, and the term of their reigns
to an hundred and twenty sari. (And among other
things not irrelative to the subject he continues thus
concerning the Deluge): After Euedoreschus some
others reigned, and then Sisithrus. To him the
deity Kronos foretold that on the fifteenth day of
the month Dæsius there would be a deluge of rain:
and he commanded him to deposit all the writings
whatever which were in his possession in Sippara the
city of the sun. Sisithrus, when he had complied
with these commands, sailed immediately to Armenia,
and was presently inspired by God. Upon the third
day after the cessation of the rain Sisithrus sent out
birds by way of experiment, that he might judge
whether the flood had subsided. But the birds,
passing over an unbounded sea without finding any
place of rest, returned again to Sisithrus. This he
repeated with other birds. And when upon the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
trial he succeeded, for the birds then returned with
their feet stained with mud, the gods translated him
from among men. With respect to the vessel, which
yet remains in Armenia, it is a custom of the inhabitants
to form bracelets and amulets of its wood.—<i>Syncel.
Chron.</i> xxxviii.; <i>Euseb. Præp. Evan.</i> lib. ix.;
<i>Euseb. Chron.</i> v. 8.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Tower of Babel</span> (<span class="smcap">Cory</span>, p. 55).</h3>

<p>They say that the first inhabitants of the earth,
glorying in their own strength and size and despising
the gods, undertook to build a tower whose top
should reach the sky, in the place where Babylon
now stands; but when it approached the heaven the
winds assisted the gods, and overturned the work
upon its contrivers, and its ruins are said to be
still at Babylon; and the gods introduced a diversity
of tongues among men, who till that time had all
spoken the same language; and a war arose between
Kronos and Titan. The place in which they built
the tower is now called Babylon on account of the
confusion of tongues, for confusion is by the Hebrews
called Babel.—<i>Euseb. Præp. Evan.</i> lib. ix.;
<i>Syncel. Chron.</i> xliv.; <i>Euseb. Chron.</i> xiii.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Dispersion, from Hestiæus</span> (<i>Cory</i>, p. 74).</h3>

<p>The priests who escaped took with them the implements
of the worship of the Enyalian Zeus, and came
to Senaar in Babylonia. But they were again driven
from thence by the introduction of a diversity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
tongues; upon which they founded colonies in various
parts, each settling in such situations as chance
or the direction of God led them to occupy.—<i>Jos.
Ant. Jud.</i> i. c. 4; <i>Euseb. Præp. Evan.</i> ix.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Tower of Babel, from Alexander Polyhistor</span>
(<span class="smcap">Cory</span>, p. 75).</h3>

<p>The Sibyl says: That when all men formerly spoke
the same language some among them undertook to
erect a large and lofty tower, that they might climb
up into heaven. But God sending forth a whirlwind
confounded their design, and gave to each tribe a
particular language of its own, which is the reason
that the name of that city is Babylon. After the
deluge lived Titan and Prometheus, when Titan
undertook a war against Kronos.—<span class="smcap">Sync.</span> xliv.; <span class="smcap">Jos.
Ant. Jud.</span> i. c. 4.; <span class="smcap">Euseb. Præp. Evan.</span> ix.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Theogonies, from Damascius</span> (<span class="smcap">Cory</span>, p. 92).</h3>

<p>But the Babylonians, like the rest of the barbarians,
pass over in silence the One principle of the
universe, and they constitute two: Tauthe<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and
Apason,<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> making Apason the husband of Tauthe, and
denominating her the mother of the gods. And
from these proceeds an only-begotten son, Moymis,<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
which I conceive is no other than the intelligible
world proceeding from the two principles. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
them also another progeny is derived, Dache and
Dachus;<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and again a third, Kissare and Assorus,
from which last three others proceed, Anus (Anu),
and Illinus (Elum), and Aus (Hea). And of Aus
and Dauke (Dav-cina, “lady of the earth,”) is born
a son called Belus, who, they say, is the fabricator of
the world, the Demiurgus.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> their accounts of the Creation and of
the early history of the human race the
Babylonian divinities figure very prominently,
but it is often difficult to identify
the deities mentioned by the Greek authors,
because the phonetic reading of many of the names
of the Babylonian gods is still very obscure, and the
classical writers frequently replace them by the
deities of their own mythology, whom they imagined
to correspond with the Babylonian names.</p>

<p>In this chapter it is proposed to give a general
account only of certain parts of the Babylonian
mythology, in order to show the relationship between
the deities and their titles and work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>Babylonian mythology was local in origin; each
of the gods had a particular city which was the special
seat of his worship, and it is probable that the
idea of weaving the gods into a system, in which each
should have his part to play, did not arise until after
the Semitic occupation of the country. The antiquity
of this systematized mythology may, however, be
seen from the fact, that two thousand years before
the Christian era it was already completed, and its
deities definitely connected into a system which remained
with little change down to the close of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>In early times the gods were worshipped only at
their original cities or seats, the various cities or
settlements being independent of each other; but it
was natural as wars arose, and some cities gained
conquests over others, and kings gradually united the
country into monarchies, that the conquerors should
impose their gods upon the conquered. Thus arose
the system of different ranks or grades among the
gods. Colonies, again, were sent out at times, and
the colonies, as they considered themselves sons of
the cities they started from, also considered their gods
to be sons of the gods of the mother cities. Political
changes in early times led to the rise and fall of various
towns and consequently of their deities, and
gave rise to numerous myths relating to the different
personages in the mythology. In some remote age
there appear to have been three great cities in the
country, Erech, Eridu, and Nipur, and their divi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>nities
Anu, Hea, and Bel were considered the “great
gods” of the country. Subsequent changes led to
the decline of these states, but their deities still
retained their position to the end of the Babylonian
system.</p>

<p>These three leading deities formed members of a
circle of twelve gods, also called “great.” These
gods and their titles are given as:</p>

<p>1. Anu, meaning “the sky” in Accadian, king of
angels and spirits, lord of the city of Erech.</p>

<p>2. Bel, Elum or Mul in Accadian, lord of the lower
world, father of the gods, creator, lord of the city of
Nipur.</p>

<p>3. Hea, “god of the house of water,” maker of
fate, lord of the deep, god of wisdom and knowledge,
lord of the city of Eridu.</p>

<p>4. Sin, the Moon-god, Acu or Agu in Accadian, lord
of crowns, maker of brightness, lord of the city of Ur.</p>

<p>5. Merodach, “the glory of the Sun,” just prince
of the gods, lord of birth, lord of the city of Babylon.</p>

<p>6. Rimmon, the Air-god, Mirmir in Accadian, the
strong god, lord of canals and atmosphere, lord of the
city of Muru.</p>

<p>7. Samas, the Sun-god, Utuci in Accadian, judge
of heaven and earth, director of all, lord of the cities
of Larsa and Sippara.</p>

<p>8. Ninip, warrior of the gods, destroyer of the
wicked, lord of the city of Nipur.</p>

<p>9. Nergal, “illuminator of the great city” (Hades),
giant king of war, lord of the city of Cutha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>10. Nusku, holder of the golden sceptre, the lofty god.</p>

<p>11. Belat, wife of Bel, mother of the great gods,
lady of the city of Nipur.</p>

<p>12. Istar, Gingir in Accadian, eldest of heaven and
earth, raising the face of warriors.</p>

<p>Below these deities there was a large body of gods
forming the bulk of the pantheon, and below these
were arranged the Igigi, or 300 angels of heaven, and
the Anunnaki, or 600 angels of earth. Below these
again came various classes of spirits or genii called
Sedu, Vadukku, Ekimu, Gallu, and others; some of
these were evil, some good.</p>

<p>The relationship of the various principal gods and
their names, titles and offices will appear from the
following remarks.</p>

<p>At the head of the Babylonian mythology stands a
deity who was sometimes identified with the heavens,
sometimes considered as the ruler and god of heaven.
This deity is named Anu, his sign is the simple star,
the symbol of divinity, and at other times the Maltese
cross. In the philosophic theology of a later age,
Anu represents abstract divinity, and he appears
as an original principle, perhaps as the original
principle of nature. He represents the universe as
the upper and lower regions, and when these were
divided the upper region or heaven was called Anu,
while the lower region or earth was called Anatu;
Anatu being the female principle or wife of Anu.
Anu is termed the old god, and the god of the whole
of heaven and earth; one of the manifestations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Anu was under the two forms Lakhmu and Lakhamu,
which probably correspond to the Greek forms Dache
and Dachus, see p. 44.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> These forms are said to have
sprung out of the original chaos, and they are followed
by the two forms Sar and Kisar (the Kissare
and Assorus of the Greeks). Sar means the upper
hosts or expanse, Kisar the lower hosts or expanse;
these are also forms or manifestations of Anu and his
wife. Anu is further called lord of the old city, and
bears the name of Alalu. His titles generally indicate
height, antiquity, purity, divinity, and he may
be taken as the general type of divinity. Anu
was originally worshipped at the city of Erech,
which was called the city of Anu and Anatu, and the
great temple there was called the “house of Anu,”
or the “house of heaven.”</p>

<p>Anatu, the wife or consort of Anu, is generally only
a female form of Anu, but is sometimes contrasted
with him; thus, when Anu represents height and
heaven, Anatu represents depth and earth; she is
also the lady of darkness, the mother of the god Hea,
the mother of heaven and earth, the female fish-god,
and is often identified with Istar or Venus. Anatu,
however, had no existence in Accadian mythology.
She is the product of the imagination of the Semites,
whose grammar drew a distinction between the
masculine and feminine genders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>Anu and Anatu had a numerous family; among
their sons are numbered Lugal-edin, “the king of the
desert,” Latarak, Ab-gula, Kusu, and the air-god,
whose name was Ramman or Rimmon, in Accadian
Mirmir. Rimmon is god of the region of the atmosphere,
or space between the heaven and earth, he is
the god of rain, of storms and whirlwind, of thunder
and lightning, of floods and watercourses. He was
in high esteem in Syria and Arabia, where he bore the
name of Dadda; in Armenia he was called Teiseba.
Rimmon is always considered an active deity, and was
extensively worshipped.</p>

<p>Another important god, a son of Anu, was the god of
fire, whose name was Gibil in Accadian. The fire-god
takes an active part in the numerous mythological tablets
and legends, and is considered to be the most potent
deity in relation to witchcraft and spells generally.</p>

<p>The most important of the daughters of Anu was
named Istar; she was in some respects the equivalent
of the classical Venus. Her worship was at first subordinate
to that of Anu, and as she was goddess of
love, while Anu was god of heaven, it is probable
that the first intention in the mythology was only to
represent love as heaven-born; but in time a more
sensual view prevailed, and the worship of Istar
became one of the darkest features in Babylonian
mythology. As the worship of this goddess increased
in favour, it gradually superseded that of Anu, until
in time his temple, the house of heaven, came to be
regarded as the temple of Venus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>The planet Venus, as the evening star, was identified
with Istar of Erech, while the morning
star was Anunit, goddess of Agané.</p>

<p>Istar, however, was worshipped under a great
variety of forms. Each city, each state, had its own
special Istar and its own special worship of her. In
the syncretic age of Babylonian theology, these
various forms and modes of worship were amalgamated
together, and epithets of the goddess which
were originally peculiar to particular localities, were
applied to the single goddess of the state religion.
Thus, according to the legends of one part of Babylonia,
Istar was the daughter of the Moon-god,
according to those of another part of the country she
was the daughter of Anu. Hence in the mythology of
a later period she appears sometimes as the daughter
of the one deity, sometimes as the daughter of the
other.</p>

<p>A companion deity with Anu is Hea, who is god,
of the sea and of Hades, in fact of all the lower regions.
In some of his attributes he answers to the
Kronos of the Greeks, in others to their Poseidon.
Hea is called god of the lower region, he is lord of
the sea or abyss; he is also lord of generation and
of all human beings and bears the titles: lord of
wisdom, of mines and treasures; of gifts, of music,
of fishermen and sailors, and of Hades or hell. It
has been supposed that the serpent was one of
his emblems, and that he was the Oannes of Berosus;
but these conjectures have not yet been proved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
The wife of Hea was Davkina, the Davke of
Damascius, who is the goddess of the lower regions,
the consort of the deep; and their principal
son was Maruduk or Merodach, the Bel of later
times.</p>

<p>Merodach, god of Babylon, appears in all the
earlier inscriptions as the agent of his father Hea;
he goes about the world collecting information, and
receives commissions from his father to set right all
that appears wrong. He is called the redeemer of
mankind, the restorer to life, and the raiser from the
dead. He is an active agent in creation, but is
always subordinate to his father Hea. In later
times, after Babylon had been made the capital,
Merodach, who was god of that city, was raised to
the head of the Pantheon. Merodach afterwards
came to be identified with the classical Jupiter, but
the name Bel, “the lord,” was only given to him in
times subsequent to the rise of Babylon, when the
worship of the older Bel, the Accadian Elum, was
falling into decay. The wife of Merodach was Zirat-panit,
perhaps the Succoth Benoth of the Bible. Besides
Merodach, Hea had a numerous progeny, his
sons being principally river-gods.</p>

<p>Nebo, the god of knowledge and literature, who
was worshipped at the neighbouring city of Borsippa,
was a favourite deity in later times, as was also his
consort Tasmit “the Hearer.” Nebo, whose name
signifies “the prophet,” was called Timkhir in Accadian,
and had his temple in the island of Dilvun,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
called “the island of the gods” by the Accadians,
now Bahrein. Here he was worshipped under the
name of Enzak.</p>

<p>A third great god was united with Anu and Hea,
named Enu, Mul, and Elum in Accadian, and Bel in
Semitic Babylonian; he was the original Bel of the
Babylonian mythology, and was lord of the surface
of the earth and the affairs of men. Elum was lord
of the city of Nipur, and in the Semitic period had a
consort named Belat or Beltis. He was held to be
the most active of the gods in the general affairs of
mankind, and was so generally worshipped in early
times that he came to be regarded as the national
divinity, and his temple at the city of Nipur was
regarded as the type of all others. The extensive
worship of Bel, and the high honour in which he
was held, seem to point to a time when his city,
Nipur, was the metropolis of the country.</p>

<p>Belat, or Beltis, the wife of Bel, is a famous deity
celebrated in all ages, but as the title Belat only
signified “lady,” or “goddess,” it was a common one
for many goddesses, and the notices of Beltis probably
refer to several different personages.</p>

<p>Bel had, like the other gods, a numerous family; his
eldest son was the moon-god, called Agu or Acu in
Accadian, in later times generally termed Sin. Sin
was presiding deity of the city of Ur, and early
assumed an important place in the mythology. The
moon-god figures prominently in some early legends,
and during the time when the city of Ur was capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
of the country his worship became very widely-spread
and popular throughout the country.</p>

<p>Ninip, god of hunting and war, was another celebrated
son of Bel; he was worshipped with his father
at Nipur. Ninip was also much worshipped in
Assyria as well as Babylonia, his character as presiding
genius of war and the chase making him a
favourite deity with the warlike kings of Assyria.
Originally he was a form of the sun-god.</p>

<p>Sin the moon-god had a son Samas, the sun-god.
Samas is an active deity in some of the Izdubar
legends and fables, but he is generally subordinate
to Sin. In the Babylonian system the moon takes
precedence of the sun, as befitted a nation of
astronomers, and the Samas of Larsa was probably
considered a different deity from Samas of
Sippara.</p>

<p>Among the other deities of the Babylonians may
be counted Nergal, god of Cutha, who like Ninip,
presided over hunting and war, and Anunit, the
goddess of one of the quarters of Sippara, and of
the city of Agané.</p>

<p>The following table will exhibit the relationship of
the principal deities as it had been drawn up by the
native writers on the cosmogony; but it must be
noted that it belongs to a late age of syncretic philosophy,
when the scholars of Assur-bani-pal’s court
were endeavouring to resolve the old deities of
Accad into mere abstractions, and so explain the
myths which described the creation of the world.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is extremely unfortunate that the legend
of the Creation in days has reached us in
so fragmentary a condition. It is evident,
however, that in its present form it is of
Assyrian, not of Babylonian, origin, and was probably
composed in the time of Assur-bani-pal. It breathes
throughout the spirit of a later age, its language and
style show no traces of an Accadian original, and the
colophon at the end implies by its silence that it was
not a copy of an older document. No doubt the
story itself was an ancient one; the number seven
was a sacred number among the Accadians, who invented
the week of seven days, and kept a seventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>day
Sabbath, and excavations in Babylonia may yet
bring to light the early Chaldean form of the legend.
But this we do not at present possess.</p>

<p>So far as the fragments can be arranged, they seem
to observe the following order:—</p>

<ul><li>1. Part of the first tablet, giving an account of the
Chaos and the generation of the gods.</li>

<li>2. Fragment of subsequent tablet, perhaps the
second on the foundation of the deep.</li>

<li>3. Fragment of tablet placed here with great
doubt, possibly referring to the creation of land.</li>

<li>4. Part of the fifth tablet, recording the creation of
the heavenly bodies.</li>

<li>5. Fragment of the seventh? tablet, recording the
creation of land animals.</li>
</ul>

<p>These fragments indicate that the series included
at least seven tablets, the writing on each tablet
being in one column on the front and back, and
probably including over one hundred lines of text.</p>

<p>The first fragment in the story is the upper part
of the first tablet, giving the description of the void
or chaos, and part of the generation of the gods.
The translation is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>1. At that time above, the heaven was unnamed:</li>

<li>2. below the earth by name was unrecorded;</li>

<li>3. the boundless deep also (was) their generator.</li>

<li>4. The chaos of the sea was she who bore the whole
of them.</li>

<li>5. Their waters were collected together in one
place, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></li>

<li>6. the flowering reed was not gathered, the marsh-plant
was not grown.</li>

<li>7. At that time the gods had not been produced,
any one of them;</li>

<li>8. By name they had not been called, destiny was
not fixed.</li>

<li>9. Were made also the (great) gods,</li>

<li>10. the gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu were produced
(the first), and</li>

<li>11. to growth they ........</li>

<li>12. the gods Sar and Kisar were made next.</li>

<li>13. The days were long; a long (time passed),
(and)</li>

<li>14. the gods Anu (Bel and Hea were born of)</li>

<li>15. the gods Sar and (Kisar).......</li>
</ul>

<p>On the reverse of this tablet there are only fragments
of the eight lines of colophon, but the restoration
of the passage is easy; it reads:—</p>

<ul><li>1. First tablet of “At that time above” (name of
Creation series).</li>

<li>2. Palace of Assur-bani-pal king of nations, king
of Assyria,</li>

<li>3. to whom Nebo and Tasmit gave broad ears</li>

<li>4. (his) seeing eyes regarded the engraved characters
of the tablets;</li>

<li>5. this writing which among the kings who went
before me</li>

<li>6. none of them regarded,</li>

<li>7. the secrets of Nebo, the literature of the library
as much as is suitable,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></li>

<li>8. on tablets I wrote, I engraved, I explained,
and</li>

<li>9. for the inspection of my people within my
palace I placed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This colophon will serve to show the value attached
to the documents, and the date of the present copies.</p>

<p>The fragment of the obverse, broken as it is, is
precious as giving the description of the chaos or
desolate void before the Creation of the world, and
the first movement of creation. This corresponds
with the first two verses of the first chapter of
Genesis.</p>

<p>1. “In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth.</p>

<p>2. And the earth was without form and void; and
darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the
spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”</p>

<p>On comparing the fragment of the first tablet of
the Creation with the extract from Damascius, we
do not find any statement as to there being two principles
at first called Tauthe and Apason, and these
producing Moymis, but in the Creation tablet the
first existence is called Mummu Tiamatu, a name
meaning “the chaos of the deep.” The compound
Mummu Tiamatu, in fact, combines the two names
Moymis and Tauthe of Damascius. Tiamatu must
also be the same as the Thalatth of Berosus, which
we are expressly told was the sea. It should, therefore,
be corrected to Thavatth, as M. Lenormant proposed
some years ago. It is evident that, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
to the notion of the Babylonians, the sea was the
origin of all things, and this also agrees with the
statement of Genesis i. 2. where the chaotic waters
are called tĕhôm, “the deep,” the same word as the
Tiamat of the Creation text and the Tauthe of
Damascius.</p>

<p>The Assyrian word <i>Mummu</i> is probably connected
with the Hebrew <i>mĕhûmâh</i>, confusion, its Accadian
equivalent being <i>Umun</i>. Besides the name of the
chaotic deep called <i>tĕhôm</i> in Genesis, which is, as has
been said, evidently the Tiamat of the Creation text,
we have in Genesis the word <i>tohû</i>, waste, desolate, or
formless, applied to this chaos. The correspondence
between the inscription and Genesis is complete, since
both state that a watery chaos preceded the creation,
and formed, in fact, the origin and groundwork of the
universe. We have here not only an agreement in
sense, but, what is rarer, the same word used in both
narratives as the name of this chaos, and given also
in the account of Damascius.</p>

<p>Next we have in the inscription the creation of the
gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu; these are male and female
personifications of motion and production, and
correspond to the Dache and Dachus of Damascius, and
the moving <i>rûakh</i>, the wind, or spirit of Genesis. The
next stage in the creation was the production of Sar and
Kisar, representing the upper expanse and the lower
expanse, and corresponding with the Assorus and Kissare
of Damascius. The resemblance in these names
is probably even closer than is here represented, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Sar is generally read Assur as a deity in later times,
being an ordinary symbol for the supreme god of the
Assyrians.</p>

<p>So far as can be made out from the mutilated text,
the next step in the creation of the universe was (as
in Damascius) the generation of the three great gods,
Anu, Elum, and Hea, the Anus, Illinus, and Aus of
that writer. Anu here symbolizes the heaven, Elum
the earth, and Hea the sea.</p>

<p>It is probable that the inscription went on to relate
the generation of the other gods, and then passed to
the successive acts of creation by which the world
was fashioned.</p>

<p>The successive forms Lakhmu and Lakhamu, Sar
and Kisar, are represented in some of the lists of the
gods as names or manifestations of Anu and Anatu.
These lists were compiled at a time when a school of
monotheists had risen in Chaldea, and an attempt was
made on the part of its adherents to resolve the various
deities of the popular creed into forms of “the
one god” Anu. In each case there appears to be a
male and female principle, which principles combine
in the formation of the universe.</p>

<p>As has been already remarked, the conception of a
male and female principle was due to the Semites.
Hence it is clear that the system of cosmology embodied
in these Creation tablets was of Semitic and
not Accadian origin.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the extract from Damascius
and the account in the Creation tablet as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the successive stages or forms of the Creation, is
striking, and leaves no doubt about the source of the
quotation from the Greek writer.</p>

<p>The three next tablets in the Creation series are
absent, there being only two doubtful fragments of
this part of the story. Judging from the analogy of
the Book of Genesis, we may conjecture that this part
of the narrative contained the description of the
creation of light, of the atmosphere or firmament, of
the dry land, and of plants. One fragment which probably
belonged to this space is a small portion of the
top of a tablet referring to the fixing of the dry land;
but it may belong to a later part of the story, since it is
part of a speech to one of the gods. This fragment
is—</p>

<ul><li>1. At that time the foundations of the caverns of
rock [thou didst make];</li>

<li>2. the foundations of the caverns thou didst call
[them] (?)</li>

<li>3. the heaven was named ......</li>

<li>4. to the face of the heaven ......</li>

<li>5. thou didst give ......</li>

<li>6. a man ......</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a second more doubtful fragment which
also may come in here, and, like the last, relate to
the creation of the dry land. It is, however, given
under reserve—</p>

<ul><li>1. The god Khir ... si ....</li>

<li>2. At that time to the god ....</li>

<li>3. So be it, I concealed thee ....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_62f.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fight between Merodach (Bel) and the Dragon.</span></div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>4. from the day that thou ....</li>

<li>5. angry thou didst speak ....</li>

<li>6. The god Assur his mouth opened and spake, to
the god ....</li>

<li>7. Above the deep, the seat of ....</li>

<li>8. in front of Bit-Sarra which I have made ...</li>

<li>9. below the place I strengthen ....</li>

<li>10. Let there be made also Bit-Lusu, the seat ..</li>

<li>11. Within it his stronghold may he build and ..</li>

<li>12. At that time from the deep he raised ....</li>

<li>13. the place .... lifted up I made ....</li>

<li>14. above .... heaven ....</li>

<li>15. the place .... lifted up thou didst make.</li>

<li>16. .... the city of Assur the temples of the
great gods ....</li>

<li>17. .... his father Anu ....</li>

<li>18. the god .... thee and over all which thy
hand has made</li>

<li>19. .... thee, having, over the earth which thy
hand has made</li>

<li>20. .... having, Assur which thou hast called its
name.</li>
</ul>

<p>This fragment is both mutilated and obscure, and
it is more than doubtful whether it has anything to
do with the Creation tablets. It seems rather to be
a local legend relating to Assur, the old capital of
Assyria, and possibly recording the legend of its
foundation. Bit-Sarra or E-Sarra, “the temple of
the legions,” was dedicated to Ninip, and forms part of
the name of Tiglath-Pileser (<i>Tuculti-pal-esara</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> “Servant
of the son of Bit-Sarra,” <i>i.e.</i> Ninip). It seems
to have denoted the firmament, the “legions” or
“hosts” referring to the multitudinous spirits of
heaven. The Biblical expression “the Lord of hosts”
may be compared.</p>

<p>The next recognizable portion of the Creation
legends is the upper part of the fifth tablet, which
gives the creation of the heavenly bodies, and runs
parallel to the account of the fourth day of creation
in Genesis.</p>

<p>This tablet opens as follows:—</p>


<p class="center"><i>Fifth Tablet of Creation Legend.</i></p>


<p class="center">Obverse.</p>

<ul><li>1. (Anu) made suitable the mansions of the (seven)
great gods.</li>

<li>2. The stars he placed in them, the <i>lumasi</i><a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> he fixed.</li>

<li>3. He arranged the year according to the bounds
(or signs of the Zodiac, Heb. <i>mazzaroth</i>) that he defined.</li>

<li>4. For each of the twelve months three stars he
fixed.</li>

<li>5. From the day when the year issues forth unto
the close,</li>

<li>6. he established the mansion of the god Nibiru,
that they might know their laws (or bonds).

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></li>

<li>7. That they might not err or deflect at all,</li>

<li>8. the mansion of Bel and Hea he established
along with himself.</li>

<li>9. He opened also the great gates in the sides of
the world;</li>

<li>10. the bolts he strengthened on the left hand and
on the right.</li>

<li>11. In its centre also he made a staircase.</li>

<li>12. The moon-god he caused to beautify the thick
night.</li>

<li>13. He appointed him also to hinder (or balance)
the night, that the day may be known,</li>

<li>14. (saying): Every month, without break, observe
thy circle:</li>

<li>15. at the beginning of the month also, when the
night is at its height.</li>

<li>16. (with) the horns thou announcest that the
heaven may be known.</li>

<li>17. On the seventh day (thy) circle (begins to) fill,</li>

<li>18. but open in darkness will remain the half on
the right (?).<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></li>

<li>19. At that time the sun (will be) on the horizon
of heaven at thy (rising).</li>

<li>20. (Thy form) determine and make a (circle?).</li>

<li>21. (From hence) return (and) approach the path
of the sun.</li>

<li>22. (Then) will the darkness return; the sun will
change.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></li>

<li>23. ....... seek its road.</li>

<li>24. (Rise and) set, and judge judgment.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that is left of the reverse is the latter half of the
last line of the narrative, and the colophon, which
runs thus:—</p>

<p>..... the gods on his hearing.</p>

<p>Fifth tablet of (the series beginning) At that time
above.</p>

<p>Property of Assur-bani-pal king of nations king of
Assyria.</p>

<p>This fine fragment is a typical specimen of the
style of the whole series, and shows a marked stage
in the Creation, the appointment of the heavenly orbs.
It parallels the fourth day of Creation in the first
chapter of Genesis, where we read: “And God said,
Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
divide the day from the night; and let them be for
lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the
day from the night; and let them be for signs, and
for seasons, and for days, and years:</p>

<p>“15. And let them be for lights in the firmament of
the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

<p>“16. And God made two great lights; the greater
light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the
night; he made the stars also.</p>

<p>“17. And God set them in the firmament of the
heaven to give light upon the earth,</p>

<p>“18. And to rule over the day and over the night,
and to divide the light from the darkness: and God
saw that it was good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>“19. And the evening and morning were the
fourth day.”</p>

<p>The fragment of the first tablet of the Creation
series was introductory, and dealt with the generation
of the gods rather than the creation of the universe,
and when we remember that the fifth tablet
contains the Creation given in Genesis under the
fourth day, while a subsequent tablet, probably the
seventh, gives the creation of the animals which, according
to Genesis, took place on the sixth day, it
would seem that the events of each of the days of
Genesis were recorded on a separate tablet, and that
the numbers of the tablets generally followed in the
same order as the days of Creation in Genesis, thus:</p>


<p class="center">Genesis, Chap. I.</p>


<ul><li>V.  1 &amp; 2   agree with Tablet 1.</li>
<li>V.  3 to 5  1st day    probably with tablet 2.</li>
<li>V.  6 to 8  2nd day    probably with tablet 3.</li>
<li>V.  9 to 13 3rd day    probably with tablet 4.</li>
<li>V. 14 to 19 4th day    agree with tablet 5.</li>
<li>V. 20 to 23 5th day    probably with tablet 6.</li>
<li>V. 24 &amp; 25 6th day     probably with tablet 7.</li>
<li>V. 26 and following,   6th and 7th day, probably with tablet 8.</li>
</ul>


<p>The assertion with which the fifth tablet begins
may be compared with the oft-repeated statement of
Genesis, after each act of creative power, that “God
saw that it was good.” In fact, the difference between
the expressions used by the Hebrew and
Assyrian writers seems greater than it really is, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the word rendered “to make suitable” comes from a
root which signifies “pleasant” or “agreeable.” It
may be noted that the word <i>yuaddi</i> “he arranged”
or “appointed” in the third line has the same root as
the Hebrew <i>môădhim</i>, which is used in the same connection
Gen. i. 14 in the sense of “seasons.”</p>

<p>We next come to the creation of the heavenly orbs,
and just as the book of Genesis says they were set
for signs and seasons, for days and years, so the inscription
describes that the stars were set in courses
to define the year. The twelve constellations or
signs of the zodiac, and two other bands of constellations
are referred to, corresponding with the two sets
of twelve stars, one to the north and the other to the
south of the zodiac, which according to Diodorus
Siculus played a prominent part in Babylonian astronomy.</p>

<p>The god Nibiru appears in the astronomical tablets
as one of the stars. Here, however, in the account
of the Creation, he seems to be the deity who
specially presided over the signs of the zodiac and
the course of the year, and in a hymn to the Creator,
which will be translated further on, he takes the
place of the classical Fate, and determines the laws
of the universe generally, and of the stars in particular.
It is evident, from the opening of the inscription
on the first tablet of the great Chaldean
work on astrology and astronomy, that the functions
of the stars were according to the Babylonians to act
not only as regulators of the seasons and the year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
but to be also used as signs, as in Genesis i. 14,
for in those ages it was generally believed that
the heavenly bodies gave, by their appearance and
positions, signs of events which were coming on the
earth.</p>

<p>The passage given in the eighth line of the inscription,
to the effect that the God who created the stars
fixed places or habitations for Bel and Hea with himself
in the heavens, points to the fact that Anu, god
of the heavens, was considered to be the creator of
the heavenly hosts; for it is he who shares with Bel
and Hea the divisions of the face of the sky, which
was divided into three zones. Summer was the
season of Bel, autumn of Anu, and winter of Hea,
the season of spring not being recognized by the
Babylonians. The new moon also was called Anu
for the first five days, Hea for the next five, and Bel
for the third.</p>

<p>The ninth line of the tablet gives us an insight
into the philosophical beliefs of the early Babylonians.
They evidently considered that the world
was drawn together out of the waters, and rested or
reposed upon a vast abyss of chaotic ocean which
filled the space below the world. This dark infernal
lake was shut in by gigantic gates and strong fastenings,
which prevented the floods from overwhelming
the world. In the centre was a staircase which led
from the abyss below to the region of light above.</p>

<p>The account then goes on to describe the creation
of the moon for the purpose of beautifying the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
and regulating the calendar. The phases of the
moon are recorded: its commencing as a thin crescent
at evening on the first day of the month, and
its gradually increasing and travelling further into
the night. It will be noticed that it is regarded as
appointed, in the language of the Bible, “to divide
the day from the night,” and to be for a sign and
a season. The expression “judge judgment” may
be compared with the expression of Genesis (i. 18.)
that the sun and moon were set “to rule over the
day and over the night.” An account of the creation
of the sun probably followed upon that of the creation
of the moon.</p>

<p>The creation of the moon, however, is placed first
in accordance with the general views of the Babylonians,
who, as was natural in a people of astronomers,
honoured the moon above the sun, even
making the sun-god the son of the moon-god.</p>

<p>The details of the creation of the planets and
stars, which would have been very important to us,
are unfortunately lost, no further fragment of this
tablet having been recovered.</p>

<p>The colophon at the close of the tablet gives us,
however, part of the first line of the sixth tablet, but
not enough to determine its subject. It is probable
that this dealt with the creation of creatures of the
water and fowls of the air, and that these were the
creation of Bel, the companion deity to Anu.</p>

<p>The next tablet, the seventh in the series, is probably
represented by a curious fragment, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
found by Mr. Smith in one of the trenches at Kouyunjik.</p>

<p>This fragment is like some of the others, the upper
portion of a tablet much broken, and only valuable
from its generally clear meaning. The translation is
as follows:</p>

<ul><li>1. At that time the gods in their assembly created .....</li>

<li>2. They made suitable the strong monsters .....</li>

<li>3. They caused to come living creatures .....</li>

<li>4. cattle of the field, beasts of the field, and creeping
things of the field .....</li>

<li>5. They fixed for the living creatures .....</li>

<li>6. ..... cattle and creeping things of the city
they fixed .....</li>

<li>7. ..... the assembly of the creeping things,
the whole which were created .....</li>

<li>8. ..... which in the assembly of my family ...</li>

<li>9. ..... and the god Nin-si-ku (the lord of
noble face) joined the two together .....</li>

<li>10. ..... to the assembly of the creeping things
I gave life .....</li>

<li>11. ..... the seed of Lakhamu I destroyed .....</li>
</ul>

<p>This tablet corresponds with the sixth day of Creation
in Genesis (i. 24-25): “And God said, Let the
earth bring forth the living creature after his kind,
cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after
his kind: and it was so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>
<p>“And God made the beast of the earth after his
kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw
that it was good.”</p>

<p>The Assyrian tablet commences with a statement
of the satisfaction a former creation, apparently that
of the monsters or whales, had given; here referring
to Genesis i. 23. It then goes on to relate the creation
of living animals on land, three kinds being distinguished,
exactly agreeing with the Genesis account,
and then we have in the ninth line a curious reference
to the god Nin-si-ku (one of the names of Hea). One
of Hea’s titles was “the lord of mankind,” and Sir
Henry Rawlinson has endeavoured to show that Eridu,
the city of Hea, was identical with the Biblical Garden
of Eden. We may here notice a tablet which refers
to the creation of man. In this tablet, K 63, the creation
of the human race is given to Hea, and all the
references in other inscriptions make this his work.
As in Genesis, so in these cuneiform tablets the Creator
is made to speak and to address the objects which he
calls into existence.</p>

<p>The next fragment was supposed by Mr. Smith to
relate to the fall of man and to contain the speech of
the deity to the newly-created pair. This, however,
is extremely doubtful, as will appear from the revised
translation below. The fragment is in so broken a
condition that almost anything may be made out of
it. It is possible that nothing more is intended by it
than instructions as to the construction of an image
of a household god or spirit and the correct mode of
worshipping it.</p>

<p>The next fragment is a small one; it is the lower
corner of a tablet with the ends of a few lines. Mr.
Smith connected it with the legend of the fall of man,
but the mention of the god Sar-tuli-elli, “the king of
the illustrious mound,” would rather indicate that it
has to do with the story of the Tower of Babel. As,
however, the fragment is too small and mutilated to
decide the question, it has been allowed to remain in
the place assigned to it by Mr. Smith, and not transferred
to a later chapter.</p>

<p>According to Sir H. Rawlinson, “the holy mound”
is now represented by the ruins of Amrán. At any
rate, it stood on the site of the Tower of Babel and
was dedicated to the god Anu. Along with the adjoining
buildings, among which are to be numbered
the royal palace and the famous hanging gardens, it
formed a particular quarter of Babylon, enclosed
within its own wall and known under the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Su-Anna, the “Valley of Anu,” which Sir H. Rawlinson
proposes to read Khalannê, and identify with the
Calneh of the Old Testament. In support of his
reading he refers to the statement of the Septuagint
in Isaiah x. 9.: “Have not I taken the region above
Babylon and Khalannê, where the tower was built?”</p>

</ul>

<p>We may conclude this chapter with a fragment of
some length, which Mr. Smith erroneously supposed
to refer to the Fall. His mistake arose from the im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>perfect
state in which the text of it has been preserved,
and the consequent obscurity of its reference and
meaning. Dr. Oppert has shown that it really contains
a hymn to the Creator Hea. Before the commencement
of lines 1, 5, 11, 19, 27, and 29 on the obverse,
there are glosses stating that the divine titles commencing
these lines all apply to the same deity.
These explanatory glosses show that even in the
Assyrian time the allusions in the original text were
not all intelligible without the help of a commentary.</p>

</ul>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a second copy which presents several variations
lines 14 to 19 are omitted.</p>

<p>It is evident that this hymn to the Creator emanated
from what Sir Henry Rawlinson has termed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the monotheistic party among the ancient Babylonians,
and that the speech of Hea in lines 14 to 19
has been inserted by a poet who did not belong to it.
The various deities of the popular faith are all resolved
into the one supreme God, the maker of the
world and man, who was worshipped at Babylon
under the names of Bel, “the Lord,” and Merodach
the sun-god, at Eridu under that of Hea and at
Nipur under that of Anu. The gods of the multitude
are said to be only the fifty names of the
Creator. To him is ascribed the regulation of the
stars, the naming of the angels, and the subjection of
the subordinate demi-gods, and marginal notes
expressly state that the several titles under which
the Creator is addressed on the obverse of the tablets,
all belong to one and the same divinity.</p>

<p>In the popular mythology the part of the Creator
was usually assigned to Merodach. Thus we find
the latter deity addressed as follows in a mutilated
bilingual hymn (K 2962 <i>Obv.</i>):—</p>

<ul><li>1. [King] of the land, lord of the world,</li>

<li>2. ... protector of heaven and earth,</li>

<li>3. firstborn of the god Hea,</li>

<li>4. the restorer of heaven and earth,</li>

<li>5. ... mighty lord of mankind, king of the
world.</li>

<li>6. ... the god of gods,</li>

<li>7. (lord) of heaven and earth, who hast no equal,</li>

<li>8. companion of Anu and Bel,</li>

<li>9. the merciful one among the gods,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></li>

<li>10. the merciful who raisest the dead to life,</li>

<li>11. Merodach, the king of heaven and earth,</li>

<li>12. the king of Babylon, the lord of Bit-Saggil,</li>

<li>13. the king of Bit-Zida, the lord of the mighty
temple of life,</li>

<li>14. heaven and earth are thine,</li>

<li>15. the circuit of heaven and earth is thine,</li>

<li>16. the charm (to produce) life is thine,</li>

<li>17. the philtre of life is thine,</li>

<li>18. the Illustrious King, the mouth of the Abyss,
is thine;</li>

<li>19. mankind, (even) the men with the black heads,</li>

<li>20. living creatures, as many as are called by a
name, as exist in the land,</li>

<li>21. the four quarters of the world, as many as
there are,</li>

<li>22. the angels of the hosts of heaven and earth, as
many as there are, (are thine).</li>
</ul>

<p>In these references to the names of the living
creatures made by the Creator at the beginning of
the world, we are irresistibly reminded of the passage
in Genesis ii. 19., where we read that “out of the
ground God formed every beast of the field and
every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam
to see what he would call them: and whatsoever
Adam called every living creature, that was the
name thereof.”</p>

<p>One of the most curious statements made in these
hymns is that the race of men created by the deity
was black-headed. The same race of men is men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>tioned
elsewhere in the ancient literature of the
Accadians. Thus in a hymn to the goddess Gula,
the goddess is described as “the mother who bore
the men of the black heads,” and in another hymn
the sun-god is declared to “direct the men of the
black heads.” Sargon of Agané is further described
as ruling over “all the men of the black heads,” and
in imitation of this mode of expression Sennacherib
in later days speaks of having overcome “all the
black-headed race.” The black-headed race of Sennacherib,
however, was the Turanian population of
Elam and the adjoining districts on the east of Babylonia,
whereas it is plain that the Accadian hymns
mean by the black-headed race the Accadian people
itself. It was over them that Sargon of Agané, the
Semite, boasts of having extended his sway, though
according to an old geographical list it was Sumer or
Shinar rather than Accad, which was inhabited by
the people of “the black-face.” But after all there
is no contradiction between the statements of Sennacherib
and of the hymns. The Accadians belonged
to the same race as the Turanian inhabitants
of Elam, and spoke a similar language to theirs.</p>

<p>Now we shall find in the account of the exploits of
Dibbara, which will be translated in a subsequent
chapter, that the black race, which is identified with
the Accadians, is contrasted with the people of Syria,
while in the bilingual tablets, the black race is similarly
contrasted with the white race. Hence it is
clear that the white race was the same as the Syrians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
and since the Syrians were Semites, the white race
must have been synonymous in the language of the Accadians
with Semitic. As a matter of fact, the Semites
belong to the white-skinned division of mankind,
and were accordingly painted yellow by the
Egyptians. The Accadian population, on the other
hand, belonged to the dark-skinned division, though
it is not necessary to suppose them to have been as
black as the negro or the “blameless Ethiopian.” In
the bilingual tablets, the black race is rendered in
Assyrian by the word <i>Adamatu</i> or “red-skins.”</p>

<p>A popular etymology connected this word <i>Adamatu</i>
with the word <i>Adamu</i> or <i>admu</i>, “man,” partly
on account of the similarity of sound, partly because
in the age of Accadian supremacy and literature, the
men <i>par excellence</i>, the special human beings made by
the Creator, were the dark-skinned race of Accad.
The Accadian Adam or “man” was dark; it was only
when the culture of the Accadians had been handed
on to their Semitic successors that he became fair.</p>

<p>The discovery that the Biblical Adam is identical
with the Assyrian <i>Adamu</i> or “man,” and that the
Assyrian <i>Adamu</i> goes back to the first-created man
of Accadian tradition who belonged to the black, that
is, to the Accadian race, is due to Sir Henry Rawlinson.
He has also suggested that the contrast between
the black and the white races, between the Accadian
and the Semite, is indicated in the sixth chapter of
Genesis, where a contrast is drawn between the daughters
of men, or <i>Adamu</i>, and the sons of God. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
owing to the intermarriage of the sons of God with the
Adamites that the evils were spread which brought
down upon the world the punishment of the Deluge.</p>

<p>It was Sir Henry Rawlinson who further pointed
out that the Biblical Gân Eden, or “Garden of Eden,”
is Gan-Duniyas (also called Gun-duni), a name under
which Babylonia is frequently known in the Assyrian
inscriptions. Gan-Duniyas signifies “the enclosure”
or “fortress of the god Duniyas,” a deity whose nature
and attributes are still obscure, and who may have
been merely a deified monarch of the country. Two
of the four rivers of Paradise are the two great rivers
that enclose the fruitful plain of Babylonia, the Tigris,
and the Euphrates. The Euphrates was called Purrat,
or “the curving water” in Accadian from its
shape; the Tigris was known under the name of
Masgugar, “the current,” Tiggar, and Idikna or
Idikla, from the latter of which comes the Hiddekhel
of Genesis, with prefixed Accadian <i>hid</i>, “river.”
Gihon is identified with the Arakhtu or Araxes, “the
river of Babylon,” which flowed westward into the
desert of Arabia or Cush, though Sir H. Rawlinson
suggests its identity with the modern Jukhá, which
runs past the site of Eridu, while Sargon calls Elam
the country of “the four rivers.”<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The tree of life was well known to the Accadians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
and the Assyrians after them, and the bas-reliefs of
Nineveh frequently present us with a representation
of it, guarded on either side by a winged cherub who
has the head sometimes of a man, sometimes of an eagle.
The tree always assumes a conventional form, and since
it generally bears fir-cones we may infer that the Accadians
brought the tradition of it with them from their
original seat in the colder mountainous land of Media,
where the fir was plentiful, and identified it with the
palm-tree only after their settlement in Chaldea. An
old name of Babylon, or of a part of Babylon, was
Din-Tir, “the life of the forest,” which may possibly
have some connection with the tree of life. The special
spot, however, in which the site of the tree of life
was localized was close to the city of Eridu, now represented
by Dhib according to Sir H. Rawlinson,
where the solar hero Tammuz was supposed to have
received the death-blow which obliged him to spend
one half the year in the lower world.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sacred Tree, or Grove, with attendant Cherubim,
from Assyrian Cylinder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A fragmentary bilingual hymn speaks thus of the
sacred spot, and of the tree of life that grew therein:—</p>

<ul><li>1. In Eridu a dark pine grew, in an illustrious
place it was planted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></li>

<li>2. Its (root) was of white crystal which spread
towards the deep.</li>

<li>3. The (shrine?) of Hea (was) its pasturage in
Eridu, a canal full of (water).</li>

<li>4. Its seat (was) the (central) place of this earth.</li>

<li>5. Its shrine (was) the couch of mother Zicum,
(the mother of gods and men).</li>

<li>6. The (roof) of its illustrious temple like a forest
spread its shade; there (was) none who within entered.</li>

<li>7. (It was the seat) of the mighty mother (Zicum),
the begetter of Anu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eridu was the special seat of the worship of Hea,
and was often known as “the good city.”</p>

<p>The flaming sword, which according to Genesis
guarded the approach to the tree of life is paralleled
by the flaming sword of Merodach, which is explained
to be the lightning. It was with this sword which is
represented on the monuments as having the form of
a sickle like the sword of the Greek hero Perseus,
that Merodach overthrew the dragon and the powers
of darkness. A hymn put into the mouth of Merodach,
thus speaks of it:—</p>

<ul><li>The sun of fifty faces, the lofty weapon of my
divinity, I bear.</li>

<li>The hero that striketh the mountains, the propitious
sun of the morning, that is mine, I bear.</li>

<li>My mighty weapon, which like an orb smites in a
circle the corpses of the fighters, I bear.</li>

<li>The striker of mountains, my murderous weapon
of Anu, I bear.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></li>

<li>The striker of mountains, the fish with seven tails,
that is mine, I bear.</li>

<li>The terror of battle, the destroyer of rebel lands,
that is mine, I bear.</li>

<li>The defender of conquests, the great sword, the
falchion of my divinity, I bear.</li>

<li>That from whose hand the mountain escapes not,
the hand of the hero of battle, which is mine, I bear.</li>

<li>The delight (?) of heroes, my spear of battle, (I bear).</li>

<li>My crown which strikes against men, the bow of
the lightning, (I bear).</li>

<li>The crusher of the temples of rebel lands, my club
and buckler of battle, (I bear).</li>

<li>The lightning of battle, my weapon of fifty heads,
(I bear).</li>

<li>The feathered monster of seven heads, like the
huge serpent of seven heads, (I bear).</li>

<li>Like the serpent that beats the sea, (which attacks)
the foe in the face,</li>

<li>the devastator of forceful battle, lord over heaven
and earth, the weapon of (seven) heads, (I bear).</li>

<li>That which maketh the light come forth like day,
god of the East, my burning power, (I bear).</li>

<li>The establisher of heaven and earth, the fire-god,
who has not his rival, (I bear).</li>
</ul>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sacred Tree, Seated Figure on each side, and Serpent in

</div>

<p>Allusion is made in this hymn, it will be noticed,
to a fabulous serpent with seven heads, which beats
the sea into waves. This serpent was originally
identical with the dragon of the deep, combated by
Merodach, as we shall learn from a fragment to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
translated hereafter, that is to say with the principle
of chaos and darkness, called Mummu Tiamtu, “the
chaos of the deep,” in the account of the creation.
It is also described as “the serpent of night,” “the
serpent of darkness,” “the wicked serpent,” and “the
mightily strong serpent,” epithets which show that it
was on the one hand the embodiment of moral evil,
and on the other was primitively nothing more than
the darkness destroyed by the sun, the bright power
of day. It is difficult not to compare the serpent of
Genesis with this serpent of Babylonian mythology.
No Chaldean legend of the Fall has as yet been found,
but when we remember how few Chaldean legends
have been discovered, and that even for these we are
dependent on the selection and copies of Assyrian
scribes, we need not be surprised that such should be
the case. The Babylonian colouring of the history
in Genesis, the fact that the rivers of Paradise are
Babylonian rivers, and that the tree of life was familiar
to Babylonian art and tradition, make it probable
that we shall yet discover the Chaldean version
of the Fall of Man as soon as the libraries of Babylonia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
have been explored. Indeed, this is made almost
certain by the existence of an early Babylonian seal,
now in the British Museum, on which a tree is represented
with a human figure seated on either side of
it, with the hands stretched out towards the fruit, and
a serpent standing erect behind one of them. We know
that the devices on these early seals were taken from
the popular legends and myths. It must be admitted,
however, that the two figures seem both to be males.</p>

<p>But if references to the Fall are few and obscure,
there can be no doubt that the Sabbath was an Accadian
institution, intimately connected with the
worship of the seven planets. The astronomical
tablets have shown that the seven-day week was of
Accadian origin, each day of it being dedicated to the
sun, moon, and five planets, and the word Sabbath
itself, under the form of <i>Sabattu</i>, was known to the
Assyrians, and explained by them as “a day of rest
for the heart.” A calendar of Saint’s days for the
month of the intercalary Elul makes the 7th, 14th,
19th, 21st, and 28th days of the lunar month Sabbaths
on which no work was allowed to be done. The
Accadian words by which the idea of Sabbath is denoted,
literally mean, “a day on which work is unlawful,”
and are interpreted in the bilingual tablets
as signifying “a day of peace” or “completion of
labours.” The calendar lays down the following injunctions
to the king for each of these sabbaths:—</p>

<p>A Sabbath: the prince of many nations
the flesh of animals and cooked food may not eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>The garments of his body he may not change.
White robes he may not put on.</p>

<p>Sacrifice he may not offer. The king may not ride
in his chariot.</p>

<p>In royal fashion he may not legislate. A review
of the army the general may not hold.</p>

<p>Medicine for his sickness of body he may not apply.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Merodach attacking the Serpent, on an Assyrian Cylinder, in

</div>

<p>The antiquity of this text is evident not only from
the fact that it has been translated from an Accadian
original, but also from the word rendered “prince,”
which literally means “a shepherd,” and takes us
back to the early times when the Accadian monarchs
still remembered that their predecessors had been
only shepherd-chieftains.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, it must be noted
that the word translated “the sea,” in lines three and
seven of the reverse of the hymn to the Creator, is
Tiamtu, which, as we have seen, was the name applied
to the deep, upon which the Babylonians believed
that the earth rested, and out of which it had been
brought into existence.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> traditions embodied by Accadians
and Assyrians in the literature of which
specimens have been given in the preceding
chapter, had been handed down
by word of mouth through many generations, and
committed to writing only at a comparatively late
period. When such is the case, traditions are naturally
liable to vary, sometimes very widely, according to
the period and condition of the country. Thus many
different versions of a story arise, and there can be no
doubt that this was actually the case with the Creation
legends. The account of the Creation in six days was
not the only account of the Creation current among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the inhabitants of Assyria and Babylonia. It was
but one out of many which had slowly grown up
among the people, and been finally thrown into a
literary form. The story of the Creation transmitted
through Berosus (see chapter iii. pp. 34-36), for example,
supplies us with an account which differs entirely
from the cuneiform account in the last chapter as
well as from the Genesis account, and some fragments
of tablets from Kouyunjik belonging to the library
of Assur-bani-pal give a copy, mutilated as usual, of a
third version which has, however, points of agreement
with the account of Berosus. This legend, of which
the following is a translation, is stated to be copied
from a tablet at Cutha.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sacred Tree, attendant Figures and Eagle-headed Men, from the
seal of a Syrian Chief, ninth century b.c.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This is a very obscure inscription, the first column,
however, forms part of a relation similar to that of
Berosus in his history of the Creation; the beings who
were killed by the light, and those with men’s heads
and bird’s bodies, and bird’s heads and men’s bodies,
agree with the composite monsters of Berosus, while
the goddess of chaos, Tiamtu, who is over them, is the
same as the Thalatth of the Greek writer. It may
be remarked that the doctrine of the Greek philosopher,
Anaximander, that man has developed out
of creatures of various shape, and once like the fish
was an inhabitant of the water, is but a reminiscence
of the old Babylonian legend.</p>

<p>The relation in the third column of the inscription
is difficult, and does not correspond with any
known incident. The fourth column contains an
address to any future king who should read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
inscription which was deposited in the temple of
Nergal at Cutha.</p>

<p>It is possible that this legend was supposed to be
the work of one of the mythical kings of Chaldea,
who describes the condition and history of the world
before his time.</p>

<p>The war carried on against the monstrous creations
of Tiamtu, described in this myth, was but one
version of the war waged against Tiamtu, or Chaos,
herself by the sun-god Merodach. The most famous
form taken by the story of this war was that which
described the attack of the seven wicked spirits, or
storm-demons, against the moon, and their final
discomfiture by the bright power of day. This
attack was a primitive attempt to account for lunar
eclipses, dressed up in poetry, and may be compared
with the Chinese belief that when the moon is
eclipsed it has been devoured by the dragon of night.
Similarly the Egyptians told how Set or Typhon
pursued the moon, the eye of Horus, how it waned
week by week as he struck it, and finally passed into
eclipse when he blinded it altogether. According
to Hindu legend, the immortal head of the serpent-demon
Râhu, cut off by Vishnu who had been
informed by the sun and moon of his theft of the
drink of immortality, incessantly pursues the two
informers in order to devour them, and a Scandinavian
myth makes the sun and moon to be always
pursued by two wolves, Sköll and Hati, the latter of
whom, also called Mânagarmr or dog of the moon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
will at the end of the times swallow up the chief
luminary of night.</p>

<p>Most of the remainder of the legend, consisting of

fracture of the tablet. What is left, however, shows
that Merodach, “the brilliance of the sun,” for such
is the meaning of his name, who always appears in
the Accadian hymns as a kind of Babylonian Prometheus
and universal benefactor, comes to the help of
the “labouring” moon, and “awe” goes before him.
Dressed in “glistening armour of unsoiled cloths and
broad garments,” he enters “the gate of the palace,”
“a king, the son of his god, who, like the bright one,
the moon-god, sustains the life of the land,” and there
with a helmet of “light like the fire” upon his head,
successfully overthrows the seven powers of darkness.
The poem concludes with a prayer that they may
never descend into the land, and traverse its borders.</p>

<p>In this story, which differs again from all the others,
Bel is supposed to place in the heaven the Moon,
Sun, and Venus, the representative of the stars. The
details have no analogy with the other stories, and
this can only be considered a poetical myth of the
Creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>This legend is part of the sixteenth tablet of the
series on evil spirits; but the tablet contains other
matters as well, the legend apparently being only
quoted in it. There is another remarkable legend of
the same sort in praise of the fire-god, on another tablet
of this series published in “Cuneiform Inscriptions,”
vol. iv. p. 15. The whole of this series concerns the
wanderings of the god Merodach, who goes about the
world seeking to remove curses and spells, and in
every difficulty applying to his father Hea to learn
how to combat the influence of the evil spirits, to
whom all misfortunes were attributed.</p>

<p>The seven evil spirits illustrate well the way in
which a moral signification may come to be attached
to what was originally a purely physical myth. They
are frequently mentioned in the literature of ancient
Accad. Thus the twenty-third book, on eclipses of
the moon, of the great work on astronomy compiled
for Sargon of Agané, states that: “When the moon
shall describe a section (in) the upper circle (of its
revolution), the gods of heaven and earth bring about
dearth of men (and) their overthrow; and (there is)
eclipse, inundation, sickness, (and) death; the seven
great spirits before the moon are broken.” Elsewhere,
an Accadian hymn, which has an interlinear
Assyrian translation attached to it, speaks as follows
of these dreaded spirits:—</p>

<ul><li>1. Seven (they) are, seven they (are).</li>

<li>2. In the abyss of the deep seven they (are).</li>

<li>3. The splendours of heaven (are) those seven.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></li>

<li>4. In the abyss of the deep, (in) a palace, (was)
their growth.</li>

<li>5. Male they (are) not, female they (are) not. [The
Accadian text, in accordance with the respect paid to
women in Accad, reverses this order.]</li>

<li>6. As for them, the deep (is) their binder.</li>

<li>7. Wife they have not, son is not born to them.</li>

<li>8. Reverence (and) kindness know they not.</li>

<li>9. Prayer and supplication hear they not.</li>

<li>10. (Among) the thorns (?) on the mountain (was)
their growth.</li>

<li>11. To Hea are they foes.</li>

<li>12. The throne-bearers of the gods (are) they.</li>

<li>13. Destroying the roads on the paths are they set.</li>

<li>14. Wicked (are) they, wicked (are) they;</li>

<li>15. seven (are) they, seven (are) they, seven twice
again (are) they.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another Accadian poet, who lived at Eridu, the
supposed site of Paradise, at the junction of the Tigris
and Euphrates, has left another account of the Seven
wicked spirits in the hymn to the fire-god mentioned
above. He says of them:—</p>

<ul><li>1. O god of fire, those seven how were they begotten,
how grew they up?</li>

<li>2. Those seven in the mountain of the sunset were
born;</li>

<li>3. those seven in the mountain of the sunrise grew
up.</li>

<li>4. In the deep places of the earth have they their
dwelling.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></li>

<li>5. In the high places of the earth have they their
name.</li>

<li>6. As for them, in heaven and earth wide is their
habitation.</li>

<li>7. Among the gods their couch they have not.</li>

<li>8. Their name in heaven (and) earth exists not.</li>

<li>9. Seven they (are); in the mountain of the sunset
do they rise.</li>

<li>10. Seven they (are); in the mountain of the sunrise
did they set.</li>

<li>11. In the deep places of the earth did they rest
their feet.</li>

<li>12. On the high places of the earth do they lift
up their head.</li>

<li>13. As for them, goods they know not, in heaven
(and) earth are they not learned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Merodach is then ordered to fetch “the laurel, the
baleful tree that breaks in pieces the incubi, the name
whereof Hea remembers in his heart, in the mighty
enclosure, the girdle of Eridu,” in order that the seven
evil spirits may be driven away. Can this laurel-tree
be the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? It
must be remembered that Hea was “the lord of wisdom,”
and under the form of a fish as Oannes or <i>Hea
Khan</i> was supposed to have ascended from the Persian
Gulf, and taught the primitive Babylonians the
elements of culture and civilization.</p>

<p>At the head of the seven evil spirits stood Tiamtu,
the representative of chaos and darkness. One of the
most remarkable Babylonian legends yet discovered is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
one which tells of the primæval struggle between
Tiamtu and Merodach, between light and darkness or
good and evil, and which does but embody in a new
shape the conception which found expression in the
myth of the war against the moon. The tablets which
contain this legend are unfortunately in a very fragmentary
condition.</p>

<p>The first of these is K 4832, too mutilated to
translate; it contains speeches of the gods before the
war.</p>

<p>The second fragment, K 3473, contains also
speeches, and shows the gods preparing for battle.
It is so terribly broken that translation is impossible,
and all that can be made out is a line here and
there.</p>

<p>The third fragment, K 3938, is on the same subject;
some lines of this give the following general
meaning:—</p>

<ul><li>1. winged thunderbolts ....</li>

<li>2. fear he made to carry ....</li>

<li>3. their sight very great (?) ....</li>

<li>4. their bodies may he destroy and ....</li>

<li>5. he raised; it was suitable, the strong serpent ....</li>

<li>6. Udgallum, Urbat<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and the god ....</li>

<li>7. days arranged, five (?) ....</li>

<li>8. carrying weapons unyielding ....</li>

<li>9. her breast, her back ....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></li>

<li>10. flowing (?) and first ....</li>

<li>11. among the gods collected ....</li>

<li>12. the god Kingu subdued ....</li>

<li>13. marching in front before ....</li>

<li>14. carrying weapons thou ...</li>

<li>15. upon war ....</li>

<li>16. his hand appointed ....</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more similar broken lines, and on
the other side fragments of a speech by some being
who desires Tiamtu to make war.</p>

<p>All these fragments are not sufficiently complete to
allow us to translate them with certainty, or even to
ascertain their order.</p>

<p>The fourth fragment, K 3449, relates to the making
of weapons to arm the god who should meet in war
the dragon.</p>

<p>This reads with some doubt on account of its
mutilation:</p>

<ul><li>1. The scimitar he had made the gods saw</li>

<li>2. and they saw also the bow how it had been
stored up.</li>

<li>3. The work he had wrought (on his shoulder)</li>

<li>4. he raised and Anu in the assembly of the gods</li>

<li>5. kissed the bow; it (he addressed),</li>

<li>6. and he spake of the bow thus (and said)</li>

<li>7. The illustrious wood I have drawn out once
and twice,</li>

<li>8. thrice also, her punishment the star of the bow
in heaven (shall effect)</li>

<li>9. and I have made (it) the protection (of mankind).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></li>

<li>10. From the choice of ....</li>

<p>The next fragment or collection of fragments gives
the final struggle between Tiamtu and Bel Merodach.
The <i>saparu</i>, or sickle-shaped sword, is always represented
both in the sculptures and inscriptions as a
weapon of Bel Merodach in this war.</p>

</ul>

<p>Again the main difficulty arises from the fragmentary
state of the documents, it being impossible
even to decide the order of the fragments. It appears,
however, that the gods have fashioned for them
a scimitar and a bow to fight the dragon Tiamtu, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Anu proclaims great honour (fourth fragment, lines
7 to 11) to any of the gods who will engage in
battle with her. Bel or Merodach volunteers, and
goes forth armed with these weapons to fight the
dragon. Tiamtu is encouraged by one of the gods
who has become her husband, and meets Merodach
in battle. The description of the fight and the subsequent
triumph of the god are very fine, and remarkably
curious in their details, but the connection
between the fragments is so uncertain at present
that it is better to reserve comment upon them until
the text is more complete. The scimitar with which
Merodach is armed is shown by the cylinders and
bas-reliefs to have been of the shape of a sickle, and
is therefore the same as the <i>harpê</i> or <i>khereb</i> with which
the Greek hero Perseus was armed when he went
forth to fight against the dragon of the sea at Joppa.
The dragon itself, according to the representations of
the monuments, was a composite monster, with the
tail, horns, claws, and wings of the mediæval devil.
The whole war between the powers of good and evil,
chaos and order, finds its parallel in the war between
Michael and the dragon in Revelation xii.
7 to 9, where the dragon is called “the great dragon,
that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, which
deceiveth the whole world.” This description is
strikingly like the impression gathered from the
fragments of the cuneiform story; the dragon Tiamtu
who fought against the gods, and whose fate it was to
be conquered in a celestial war, closely corresponds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
in all essential points with the dragon conquered by
Michael. That the dragon originally symbolized the
sea is one proof out of many that the Accadians were
a seafaring people, well acquainted with the terrors
of the deep, when the waves conspire with the storm-clouds,
those seven evil spirits, to throw all nature
once more into its primeval anarchy.</p>

<small>THE SIN OF THE GOD ZU.</small></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/a.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Among</span> the legends of the gods, companion
stories to the accounts of the
Creation and Deluge, one of the most
curious is the legend of the sin committed
by the god Zu.</p>

<p>This legend stands quite alone, its incidents and
its principal actor being otherwise almost unknown
from cuneiform sources. Only one copy of the story
has at present been detected, and this is in so mutilated
a condition that it cannot be connected with
any other of the legends. It belongs to the same
cycle of myths as the myth of the exploits of Dibbara,
which will be given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The principal actor in the legend is a god named
Zu, the name being found in all the three cases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
an Assyrian noun Zu, Za, and Zi. Analogy would
lead us to infer that the name had been borrowed by
the Assyrians from the Accadians, as well as the
story with which it is connected.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith compared the legend with that of the
mutilation of Uranus by his son Kronus, and with
the history of the outrage of Ham on his father Noah;
but its real analogue is the myth of Prometheus, the
benefactor of men, who stole the fire of heaven for
their sake, and brought upon himself the anger and
punishment of Zeus. It contains two difficult words,
<i>partsi</i> and <i>tereti</i>. The first is ambiguous, meaning
either “oracles” or “shrines,” but since it is coupled
with <i>dup-simi</i>, “tablets of destiny,” it is probably to
be rendered “oracles.” <i>Tereti</i> is very obscure.
The sun-god is called “the lord of <i>tereti</i>” and the
word occurs in the hymn to the Creator, Rev. 17
(p. 79), where also it is united with <i>partsi</i>,
“command” or “oracle.” It may signify “lots.”
The tablets of destiny, stolen by Zu, for the
benefit, apparently, of mankind, formed the vault of
the palace of the under-world. We may compare the
books which are to be opened on the day of judgment
in Dan. vii. 10, and Rev. xx. 12.</p>

<p>The tablet containing the account of the sin of
Zu, K 3454, in the Museum collection, originally
contained four columns of text, each column having
about sixty lines of writing. The first and fourth
columns are almost entirely lost, there not being
enough anywhere to translate from. The mutilation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of the text seriously adds to the difficulties of translation.</p>

<p>The single fragment preserved, belonging to the
first column, mentions some being who was the seed
or firstborn of Bel, with a number of titles, such
as “warrior, soldier of the temple of Bel,” and the
name of the god Zu occurs, but not so as to prove
these titles to be his.</p>

<p>The following is a partial translation of the remains
of this tablet:—</p>


<p class="center">K. 3454.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column I.</span> lost.</p>

<li>8. he dreams that he is the father of the gods

<li>9. The desire to be Bel is taken in his heart,</li>

<li>10. Zu dreams that he is also the father of the gods,
the protector of heaven and earth.</li>

<li>11. The desire to be Bel is taken in his heart:

</ul>

<p>The rest, including Column IV., is lost.</p>

<p>Such are the fragments of the story so far as they
can be translated at present. The divine Zu here
mentioned, whose sin is spoken of, is never counted
among the gods, and there would be no clue to his
nature were it not for a curious tablet printed in
“Cuneiform Inscriptions,” vol. iv. p. 14, which
throws light on his origin and character. This
tablet gives the following curious relation:</p>

<ul><li>1. The god Lugal-turda (the valiant king) [fled]
to the mountains, a place remote;</li>

<li>2. in the mountains of Sabu [he dwelt].</li>

<li><span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

</ul>

<p>This Zu bird is plainly the same as the god Zu of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the former legend, and his nature is shown by a passage
in the annals of Assur-nazir-pal (“Cuneiform Inscriptions,”
vol. i. p. 22, col. ii. l. 107), who says that
his warriors “like the divine Zu bird upon them
darted.” This bird is called the cloud or storm-bird,
the flesh-eating bird, the lion or giant bird, the bird
of prey, the bird with sharp beak; and it is not difficult
to see what the deified bird really was. It was
clearly the storm-cloud, which appears in Aryan folklore
under the varying forms of the eagle, the woodpecker,
and the robin redbreast, the bird of Thor;
while in Chinese mythology the storm-bird is described
as “a bird which, in flying, obscures the sun,
and of whose quills are made water-tuns.” The roc
of the “Arabian Nights,” with its wings of ten thousand
fathoms in width, and its egg, which it was a sin in
Aladdin to wish to take from the place where it hung,
is but an echo of the Chinese storm-bird; and the
identity of the Chaldean Zu with the latter is demonstrated
by its Accadian name, which signifies “the
bird of the divine storm-cloud.” Just as Prometheus
brought the lightning from heaven to earth, and
suffered the penalty of enchainment to a desert rock,
so, too, the storm-bird of Accad stole the secrets of
the gods, and was punished by exile from them, and
transformation into a bird. When once the storm-cloud
had been likened to a bird, it was easy enough
to identify it with an actual bird of similar name
which swooped upon its prey with sharp beak. That
the lightning which darted from the bosom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
black tempest really formed the tablets of destiny
was a ready conclusion to a people who read the
future in the message sent through the lightning
from heaven to earth. Even the Hebrews saw in the
thunder “the voice of God.” Lugal-turda, it may be
added, was the patron of the city of Amarda or
Marad, and is said to have been the deity worshipped
by Izdubar.</p>

<p>In the story of the offence of Zu there is another
instance of the variations which constantly occur in the
Assyrian inscriptions with respect to the relationship
of the gods. Nebo is usually called son of Merodach,
but in this inscription he is called son of Anu. The
part that he plays in it is due to the fact that he
was identified with the “meridian sun.”</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> tablets recording this story are five in
number, but a few fragments only of
them have as yet been found. From
the indications presented by these fragments
the first four tablets seem each to have had
four columns of writing, while the fifth tablet was a
smaller one of two columns containing the remainder
of the story.</p>

<p>The god whose exploits are principally recorded
was the leader of the plague-demons, and bears the
name of Dibbara. He has the title of “the darkening
one,” which recalls the passage in Psalm xci. 6, “the
pestilence that walketh in darkness.”</p>

<p>He has a companion deity named Itak who marches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
before him, and seven gods who follow him in his destructive
course. The latter are the seven evil spirits
in a new form.</p>

<p>The point of the story in these tablets appears to
be, that the people of the world had offended Anu
the god of heaven, and accordingly that deity ordered
Dibbara to go forth and strike the people with the
pest. It is evident here that exactly the same views
prevailed in Babylonia as among the Jews, visitations
from pestilence or famine being always supposed to
be sent by the deity in punishment for some sin. In
fact, the account of the pestilence inflicted upon the
Israelites on account of David’s sin in numbering the
people is a striking parallel to the Accadian legend
which follows. The angel of the pestilence seen by
David, with his sword drawn, may be compared
with Dibbara, the Accadian personification of the
pest.</p>

<p>The whole of this series of tablets may be described
as a poetical picture of the destruction caused by a
plague, sweeping over district after district, and destroying
everything before it.</p>

<p>The fragment which appears to come first in the
series is a very mutilated portion of a tablet, containing
parts of three columns of writing. Only a
fragment of the first column is perfect enough to
translate, and the characters on this are so worn
that the translation cannot be other than doubtful.
It seems to read</p>

<ul><li>1. Against the paling he struck and ....</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></li>

<li>2. the fifth time he smote (?) above and below
seeking .....</li>

<li>3. seven ......</li>

<li>4. The words of the account of the seven gods all
of them Anu had heard.</li>

<li>5. He .... them also to Dibbara the warrior of
the gods: May thy hands go</li>

<li>5(sic.). whenever the people of the nations their shame
[<i>or</i> alliance] have destroyed.</li>

<li>7. I have set thy heart also to make darkness.</li>

<li>8. The people of the black heads to ruin thou shalt
strike with the desolation of the god Ner;</li>

<li>9. may thy weapons (overthrow) them, and may
thy hands go.</li>

<li>10. As for them ..... their weapons.</li>

<li>11. He said to Dibbara: ......</li>
</ul>

<p>The speech of Anu which follows is written in
characters so broken and indistinct as to make any
attempt at translation impossible.</p>

<p>The next fragment is of a different character, but
appears from its style to belong to the same series.</p>

<ul><li>1. .... he ....</li>

<li>2. .. spake to him and he explained (?) ....</li>

<li>3. .. spake to him and he learned (?) ....</li>

<li>4. Anu at the doing of Hea shouted for joy and
....</li>

<li>5. the gods of heaven and earth as many as exist
whosoever thus answered;</li>

<li>6. his command which was like the command of
Anu whosoever appointed</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></li>

<li>7. .... extending from the horizon of heaven to
the top of heaven</li>

<li>8. .... he looked and his fear he saw</li>

<li>9. .... Anu who .... over him .... made</li>

<li>10. .... of Hea his calamity (?) made</li>

<li>11. .... a fierce lord to later days to ....</li>

<li>12. .... seed of mankind</li>

<li>13. .... triumphantly the net (?) .. he broke</li>

<li>14. .... to heaven he had ascended, she thus</li>

<li>15. .... 4,021 people he had placed</li>

<li>16. .... the illness which was on the body of
the people he had placed</li>

<li>17. .... the illness the goddess of Karrak made
to cease.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next portion of the legend is a considerable
part of one of the tablets, probably the fourth, all
four columns of writing being represented. There
are many curious points in this tablet, beside the
special purpose of the legend, such as the peoples
enumerated in the fourth column, the action of the
gods of the various cities, &amp;c.</p>

<li>Fifth tablet of the exploits of the god (Dibbara).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Here we see a picture of Oriental feeling with
reference to natural phenomenon or disaster to mankind.
It is supposed that some deity or angel stands
with a sword over the devoted people and sweeps
them into eternity.</p>

<p>The first fragment shows the anger of Anu at the sin
of some doomed race, and his command to Dibbara to
take his weapon, slay the people, and desolate the land
like the god Ner. This god Ner was one of the mythical
kings of Babylon who reigned after the flood, and
is mentioned as having a terrible name and being
with Etana a dweller in Hades. The allusion to him
in this passage seems to imply that he was believed to
have once rescued Babylon from a hostile attack.</p>

<p>The next fragment exhibits the goddess of Karrak
as healing the illness of some of the people, 4,102 being
mentioned as struck with disease.</p>

<p>In the next and largest fragment the story becomes
a little more connected; it commences with a description
of preparation for battle, and goes on through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
speeches and actions to describe the course of Dibbara
and his plague that he inflicts upon Babylon, and its
besiegers where he spares neither chief nor slave, and
enters even the palace. It would seem that the sin of
the Babylonians arose from the chief priest or governor
of the city arming the troops and sending them out to
plunder the enemy. For this the plague is sent, and
its progress is graphically described. Merodach the
special protector of Babylon at last interferes, and the
god of pestilence is checked in his course. The next
city visited belongs to Samas, being either Larsa, or
Sippara, and then the plague reaches Erech. The
character of this city is described, the worship of
Venus, with her handmaids Samkhati and Kharimati,
or “Joy” and “Seduction,” the priests and ceremonies,
and the progress of the plague over the
place. Then the great god the deity of Duran comes
forward and pleads for his city, calling to mind its
uprightness and justice, and praying for its exemption
from the plague.</p>

<p>In the third column mention is made of Gutium,
under which name the Accadians designated the whole
tract of country which extended from the Tigris to
the eastern borders of Media, including the district
afterwards known as Assyria. The land of Nizir, in
which rose the mountain of Elwend, on the top of
which the Accadians supposed the ark to have rested,
also formed part of this vast tract. Sir Henry Rawlinson
long ago pointed out that Gutium must be the
Goyim of the 14th chapter of Genesis, ruled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Tidal, or rather, according to the reading of the
Septuagint, Tur-gal “the great Son.”</p>

<p>The fourth column next describes a prophecy
of Dibbara that there should be internal war among
the peoples of the Persian Gulf, of Syria, Assyria,
Elam, Gutium, Lullubu and the Kossæans, from all
which troubles benefit should come to the Accadians
or northern Babylonians. The Kossæans or Cassi inhabited
the northern part of Elam, and under Khammuragas
conquered Babylonia and founded there a
dynasty which lasted a long time. Lullubu lay
northward of Mesopotamia and Nizir.</p>

<p>Then according to his wish Dibbara sends the god
Itak his servant, with the seven warrior gods, to
devastate, and Itak sweeps over the country and
destroys it.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The last tablet deals in generalities pointing out
the action of Dibbara when his praise was neglected,
and telling all the glories and good that should come
to those who should celebrate this deity in song. On
the spread of a plague it is evident that the Babylonians
had no better means of arresting it than to
pray and praise the supposed terrible deity of the
scourge, that he might sheathe his sword of anger.</p>

<p>The antiquity of the legend is evident from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
geographical names which occur in it. A geographical
list which seems based on an Accadian original is the
only other document which speaks of Phœnicia, or
rather a part of Phœnicia, under the name of Khikhi;
and the fact that no reference is made to the Hittites
shows that the poem is earlier than the sixteenth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, when the Hittites first rose into power
in western Asia. Subartu is derived from the Accadian
<i>subar</i> “high,” applied by the Accadians to the
highlands of Aram or Syria.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Combined</span> with these stories of the gods,
traditions of the early history of man, and
accounts of the Creation, are fragments
of a series in which various animals speak
and act. As these resemble the beast-fables of other
races, more especially the African, they may be conveniently
classed under the general heading of
“Fables.” The idea that animals can speak, or have
spoken in some former age of the world, even occurs
in Genesis, where we have a speaking serpent; in
Numbers, where Balaam’s ass reproves his master; and
in the stories of Jotham and Joash, where the trees
are made to talk; as also in the Izdubar legends, where
the trees answer Hea-bani.</p>

four columns of writing. Two of the acting animals
in it are the eagle and the serpent.</p>

<p>The second is similar in character, the leading
animal being the fox or jackal, but there are only
four fragments of it; it may belong to the same series
as the fable of the eagle.</p>

<p>The third is a single tablet with two columns of
writing, and contains a discussion between the horse
and ox.</p>

<p>The fourth is a single fragment in which a calf
speaks, but there is nothing to show the nature of
the story.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">I. The Story of the Eagle.</span></h3>

<p>This story appears to be the longest and most
curious of the fables, but the very mutilated condition
of the various fragments gives as usual considerable
difficulty in attempting a translation of it. One of the
actors in the story is an ancient monarch named Etana,
who, like Ner, ruled over Babylon in the mythical
period that followed the Deluge, and whose phantom
was believed to sit, crowned, on a throne in Hades
along with the shades of the other heroes of old time.
The story of Etana was supposed to have been written
by an early poet named Nis-Sin.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine the proper order of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the fragments of the story owing to their mutilated condition;
they must therefore be translated as they come.</p>

<p>The next fragment, K 2606, is curious, as containing
an account of some early legendary story
in Babylonian history. This tablet formed the third
in the series, and from it we gain part of the title of
the tablets.</p>

<li>3. The eagle his mouth opened and to Samas

the fourth tablet.</p>

<li>9. The eagle his mouth opened and ....</li>

<li>10. Why do I go ....</li>

<li>11. the god Etana his mouth opened and ....</li>
</ul>

<p>Such are the principal fragments of this curious
legend. According to the fragment K 2527, the
serpent had committed some sin for which it was
condemned by the god Samas to be eaten by the
eagle; but the eagle declined the repast.</p>

<p>After this, some one, whose name is lost, baits a
trap for the eagle, and the bird going to get the
meat, falls into the trap and is caught. Now the
eagle is left, until dying for want of food it is glad
to eat the serpent, which it takes and tears open.
The other birds then interfere, but the tablet is
too mutilated to allow us to discover for what
purpose.</p>

<p>The other fragments concern the building of some
city, Etana being king, and in these relations the
eagle again appears; there are seven spirits or angels
principal actors in the matter, but the whole story is
obscure at present, and a connected plot cannot be
made out.</p>

<p>This fable has evidently some direct connection
with the mythical history of Babylonia, for Etana is
mentioned as an ancient Babylonian monarch in the
Izdubar legends. He seems to be the Titan of the
Greek writers, who lived after the Deluge and made
war against Kronos or Hea shortly after the confusion
of tongues. The city built by Etana may be the city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
mentioned in Gen. xi. 4 as built at the same time as
the Tower of Babel. If the Sibyl can be trusted
Titan was a contemporary of Prometheus, in whom
we may perhaps see the Inninna of the cuneiform
inscription. That Etana was closely associated with
the story of the Deluge appears plain from the
fact that he ruled at Surippak, the home and kingdom
of the Chaldean Noah. The legend of Etana seems
in the fable to be put into the mouth of the eagle.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">II. Story of the Fox.</span></p>

<p>The next fable, that of the fox, was ascribed to an
author called Lal-Merodach, the son of Eri-Turnunna,
but the fragments are so disconnected that they
must be given without any attempt at arrangement.</p>


<p class="center">K 3641.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

<li>10. The fox on hearing this, raised his head in the
presence of Samas and weeps.</li>

<li>11. To the presence of the splendour of Samas his

<li>12. by this judgment O Samas thou dost not make
me fecund.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>The next fragment has lost the commencements
and ends of all the lines.</p>

<ul><li>1. .... he carries (?) in the mouth ....</li>

<li>2. .... the face of his ....</li>

<li>3. .... thou knowest wisdom all ....</li>

<li>2. .... their shepherd was prostrate ....</li>

<li>3. .... let it not be ....</li>

<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

<li>5. ...... the fox in the trap (?) ....</li>
</ul>

<p>The last fragment is a small scrap, at the end of
which the fox petitions Samas to spare him.</p>

<p>The incidental allusions in these fragments show
that the fox was even then considered cunning, and
the animal in the story was evidently a watery specimen,
as he brings tears to his assistance whenever
anything is to be gained by it. He had offended
Samas by some means and the god sentenced him to
death, a sentence which he escaped through powerful
pleading on his own behalf.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">III. Fable of the Horse and Ox.</span></h3>

<p>The next fable, that of the horse and the ox, is a
single tablet with only two columns of text. The
date of the tablet is in the reign of Assur-bani-pal,
and there is no statement that it is copied from an
earlier text. There are altogether four portions of
the text, but only one is perfect enough to be worth
translating. This largest fragment, K 3456, contains
about one-third of the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>


<p class="center">K 3456.</p>

<li>12. the tribes of cattle rejoiced in companionship

<li>13. the ox and the horse made friendship,</li>

<li>14. their maw rejoiced when to friendship</li>

<li>15. it inclined, and their heart was glad; they
made agreement together.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

<li>16. The ox opened his mouth, and speaks; he says
to the horse glorious in war:</li>

<li>17. I am pondering now upon the good fortune at
my hand.</li>

<li>18. At the beginning of the year and the end of
the year I dream (<i>or</i> ponder) of fodder.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></li>

<li>19. The abundant floods had been dried up, the
waters of the canals were reduced,</li>

<li>20. the water-lily had drooped, it was suffering the
summer-heat,</li>

<li>21. the valleys were stony, my mountain was
perishing,</li>

<li>22. the high places had perished, the <i>zambatu</i>

<li>23. at the sight of my horn the timid fled not.</li>

<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Here the ox describes the state of the country
during the drought of summer, and makes a league
with the horse, apparently for the purpose of sharing
with him the same pastures. Most of the speeches,
however, made by the two animals are lost or only
present in small fragments, and the story recommences
on the reverse with the end of a speech from
the horse.</p>

<li>32. open first (that of) “Behold Istar the noble ....”
(Colophon)</li>

<li>Palace of Assur-bani-pal, king of nations, king (of
Assyria).</li>
</ul>

<p>It appears from these fragments that the story described
a time when the animals associated together,
and the ox and horse fell into a friendly conversation.
The ox, commencing the discussion, praised himself;
the answer of the horse is lost, but where the story
recommences it appears that the ox objects to the
horse drawing the chariot from which he himself is
hunted, and the horse ultimately offers to tell the ox
a story, the ox choosing the story called “Behold
Istar,” probably some story of the same character as
that of Istar’s descent into Hades.</p>

<p>It is uncertain if any other tablet followed this; it
is, however, probable that there was one containing
the story told by the horse. Although there is no
indication to show the date of this fable, the fact that
it is not stated to have been copied from an older
document seems to show that it is not earlier than
the time of Assur-bani-pal. The loss of the tablet
containing the story of Istar, told by the horse to the
ox, is unfortunate. The last fable is a mere fragment
similar to the others, containing a story in which the
calf speaks. There is not enough of it to make it
worth translation.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/a.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">A number</span> of stories of a similar character
to those of Genesis, though not directly
connected with the latter, have been included
in this chapter, together with two
fragments which probably relate, the one to the Tower
of Babel, the other to the destruction of the cities of
the Plain. The first and principal text is the story of
Atarpi, or Atarpi nisu, “Atarpi the man.” This
story is on a tablet in six columns, and there is only
one copy of it. It is terribly mutilated, very little
being preserved except Column III., but there are
numerous repetitions throughout the text. The inscription
has originally been a long one, probably
extending to about 400 lines of writing, and the text<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
differs from the generality of these inscriptions, being
very obscure and difficult. In consequence of this
and other reasons, only an outline of most of the story
is given here.</p>

<p>We are first told of a quarrel between a mother
named Zibanit and her daughter, and that the mother
shuts the door of the house, and turns her daughter
adrift, the words of the original being “the mother to
the daughter opens not her door.” The doings of a
man named Zamu have some connection with the
affair, his “descending into the street on getting”
something being mentioned immediately before the
expulsion of the daughter; and at the close we are
told of Atarpi, sometimes called Atarpi-nisu, or Atarpi
the “man” who had his couch beside the river of the
north, and was pious to the gods, but took no notice
of these things. When the story next opens, we find
the god Bel calling together an assembly of the gods
his sons, and relating to them that he is angry at the
sin of the world, stating also that he will bring down
upon it disease, tempest, distress, madness, burning
and sickness. This is followed by the statement that
these things came to pass, and Atarpi then invoked
his god Hea to remove these evils. For a whole year,
it would seem, he interceded for the people, and at
last Hea answered, and announced his resolve to destroy
the people. After this the story reads:</p>

<ul><li>1. (Hea called) his assembly (by the river) of the
north; he said to the gods his sons:</li>

<li>2. ...... I made them

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></li>

<li>3. .... shall not stretch until before he turns.</li>

<li>4. Their famine I observe,</li>

<li>5. their shame the woman takes not;</li>

<li>6. I will look to judge the people?</li>

<li>7. in their stomach let famine dwell,</li>

<li>8. above let Rimmon drink up his rain,</li>

<li>9. let him drink up below, let not the flood be
carried in the canals,</li>

<li>10. let it remove from the field its inundations,</li>

<li>11. let the corn-god give over increase, let blackness
overspread the corn,</li>

<li>12. let the plowed fields bring forth thorns,</li>

<li>13. let the growth of their fruit perish, let food not
come forth from it, let bread not be produced,</li>

<li>14. let distress also be spread over the people,</li>

<li>15. may favour be shut up, and good not be given.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

<li>16. He looked also to judge the people,</li>

<li>17. in their stomach dwelt famine,</li>

<li>18. above Rimmon drank up his rain,</li>

<li>19. he drank it up below, the flood was not carried
in the canals,</li>

<li>20. it removed from the field its inundations,</li>

<li>21. the corn-god gave over increase, blackness
spread over the corn,</li>

<li>22. the plowed fields brought forth thorns, the
growth of their fruit perished,</li>

<li>23. food came not forth from it, bread was not produced,</li>

<li>24. distress was spread over the people,</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></li>

<li>25. favour was shut up, good was not given.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This will serve to show the style of the tablet.
The instrument of punishment was apparently
famine from want of rain.</p>

<p>Here the story is again lost, and where it recommences
Hea is making a speech, directing another
person to cut something into portions, and place
seven on each side, and then to build brickwork round
them. After this comes a single fragment, the connection
of which with the former part is obscure.</p>

<li>6. their speech? ....</li>

<li>7. Anu sent m ....</li>

</ul>

<p>At present no satisfactory story can be made out
of the detached fragments of this tablet, but it evidently
belongs to the mythical portion of Babylonian
history, and it is impossible not to compare the unsuccessful
intercession of the righteous man Atarpi
with the pleadings of Abraham on behalf of the cities
of the plain.</p>

<p>The next text is a single fragment, K 2407, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>longing
to a curious story of a wise man who puts a
riddle to the gods.</p>


<p class="center">K 2407.</p>

<p class="center">(Many lines lost.)</p>

<ul><li>1. The clothing of the god ....</li>

<li>2. What in the house is (fixed) ....</li>

<li>3. What in the secret place is ....</li>

<li>4. what is in the foundation of the house ....</li>

<li>5. what on the floor of the house is fixed, what
...</li>

<li>6. what the lower part ....</li>

<li>7. what by the sides of the house goes down ....</li>

<li>8. what in the ditch of the house broad <i>nigitstsi</i>
....</li>

<li>9. what roars like a bull, what brays like an ass,</li>

<li>10. what flutters like a sail, what bleats like a
sheep,</li>

<li>11. what barks like a dog,</li>

<li>12. what growls like a bear,</li>

<li>13. what into the fundament of a man enters, what
into the fundament of a woman enters.</li>

<li>14. Then Lugal-girra (Nergal) heard the wise word
the son of the people</li>

<li>15. asked, and all the gods he urged (to solve it):</li>

<li>16. Let your solution be produced, that I may
bring back your answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this there is a mutilated passage containing
the names, titles, and actions of the gods who consider
the riddle. It is evident that it is air or wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
which the wise man means in his riddle, for this is
everywhere, and in its sounds imitates the cries of
animals.</p>

<p>Next we have another single fragment about a
person named Sinuri, who uses a divining rod to
ascertain the meaning of a dream.</p>

<ul><li>1. Sinuri with the cut reed pondered ....</li>

<li>2. with his right hand he broke it, and Sinuri speaks
and thus says:</li>

<li>3. Now the plant of Nusku, the shrub? of Samas
art thou.</li>

<li>4. Judge, thou judgest (<i>or</i> divinest), divine concerning
this dream,</li>

<li>5. which in the evening, at midnight, or in the
morning,</li>

<li>6. has come, which thou knowest, but I do not know.</li>

<li>7. If it be good may its good not be lost to me,</li>

<li>8. if it be evil may its evil not happen to me.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some more obscure and broken lines, but
no indication as to the story to which it belongs.</p>

<p>A specimen of early Babylonian folklore may fitly
be added here. It is a bilingual fragment which
treats of a foundling who was picked up in the
streets and finally became a great scholar. Unfortunately
both the beginning and the end of the
story are wanting.</p>

<ul><li>1. He who father and mother had not,</li>

<li>2. who his father (and) his mother knew not,</li>

<li>3. in the gutter (was) his going, in the street (his)
entering.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></li>

<li>4. From the mouth of the dogs one took him,</li>

<li>5. from the mouth of the ravens one put him
away.</li>

<li>6. In the presence of the soothsayer the .... of

<li>7. The sole of his feet with the seal the soothsayer
has marked.</li>

<li>8. To a nurse he gave him.</li>

<li>9. To his nurse for three years, corn, a cradle (?)</li>

<li>10. (and) clothing he guaranteed.</li>

<li>11. Then and ever he hid from him how he was

<li>12. His rearer he rooted out (?).</li>

<li>13. The ..... of the milk of mankind he gave
him, and</li>

<li>14. as his own son he made him.</li>

<li>15. As his own son he inscribed him.</li>

<li>16. A knowledge of writing he made him possess.</li>

<li>17. For his education (he cared).</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most obscure incidents in the Book of
Genesis is undoubtedly the building of the Tower of
Babel. So far as we can judge from the fragments
of his copyists, there was no reference to it in the
work of Berosus, and early writers had to quote from
writers of more than doubtful authority in order to
confirm it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_162.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Men engaged in Building Columns; from Babylonian Cylinder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>There is also no representation on any of the
Babylonian gems which can with any certainty be
described as belonging to this story. Mr. Smith, however,
picked out three from a series of these carvings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
which he thought might be distorted representations
of the event. In these and some others of the same
character, figures have their hands on tall piles, as if
erecting them; and there is a god always represented
near in much the same attitude. There is no proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
proportion between the supposed structure and the
men, and no stress can consequently be laid on the
representations. The Babylonian origin of the story
is, however, self-evident. According to Genesis, mankind
after the flood travelled from the east, that is
from Kharsak-kurra, “the mountain of the East,”
now Elwend, where the Accadians believed the ark
to have rested, to the plain of Shinar or Sumir. Both
Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus state that the
building of the Tower of Babel was known to Babylonian
history, Babel, in fact, being the native form
of the name which the Greeks changed into Babylon.
The legend of Etana given in the last chapter seems
to imply that the Tower was supposed to have been
built under the superintendence of this mythical hero.
However that may be, a fragment of the native story
of its construction was discovered by Mr. Smith, and
though shockingly mutilated, is sufficient to show what
the Babylonians themselves believed on the matter.</p>

<p>It is evident from the wording of the fragment that
it was preceded by at least one tablet, describing the
sin of the people in building the tower. The fragment
preserved belongs to a tablet containing from
four to six columns of writing, of which portions of
four remain. The principal part is the beginning of
Column I.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column I.</span></p>

<ul><li>1. .... them the father ....</li>

<li>14. He gave the command, he made strange their
counsel</li>

<li>15. .... the going he inspected it.</li>

<li>16. .... he took (selected) a shrine.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a small fragment of Column II., but the
connection with Column I. is not apparent.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column II.</span></p>

<p>There is a third portion on the same tablet belonging
to a column on the other side, either the

</ul>

<p>These fragments are so remarkable that it is most
unfortunate we have not the remainder of the tablet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>In the first part we have the anger of Bel, the
father of the gods, at the sin of those who were
building the walls of Babylon and the mound of
tower or palace. This mound is termed “the illustrious,”
and the god Anu who destroyed the builders
is accordingly called <i>Sar-tuli-elli</i>, “the king of the
illustrious mound.” Since the Accadian name of the
month Tisri, our October, was “the month of the
illustrious mound,” it would appear that the construction
of it was believed to have taken place at the
time of the autumnal equinox. The builders were
punished by the deity, and the walls that had been
set up in the day were destroyed at night. Prof.
Delitzsch has drawn attention to a possible reference
to this legend in an Accadian hymn in which the poet
says to Merodach, “found during the day, destroy
during the night.” It is plain from the first lines
that the whole attempt was directed against the gods;
in fact, that like the giants and Titans in Greek
mythology, whose assault on Zeus is probably but an
echo of the old Babylonian tale, conveyed to Greece
through the hands of the Phœnicians, the builders of
the Tower of Babylon intended to scale the sky.
They were, however, confounded on the mound, as
well as their speech (<i>tammasle</i>). It is interesting to
find the very same word signifying “to confound”
used in the Babylonian as in the Hebrew account,
namely <i>bâlal</i>, or rather <i>bâlâh</i>. We may also notice
that the Hebrew writer once (Gen. xi. 7.) adopts the
polytheistic language of the Accadian scribe; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Lord being made to say “Let <i>us</i> go down, and there
confound their language.”</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">View of the Birs Nimrud, the supposed site of the Tower of Babel.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The last column shows that the winds finally destroyed
the impious work of the Babylonians. This
fully accords with the legend reported by Alexander
Polyhistor. For a time Babylon was given over to
the god of lawlessness; but at last the gods repented
of the evil they had done, and order was once more
restored. The shrine mentioned in the sixteenth line
of the first column may receive some light from the
fact that the Accadian name of Nisan or March was
“the month of the upright altar,” or “of the altar of
Bel,” and that Nisan corresponded with the vernal
equinox just as Tisri did with the autumnal equinox.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">View of the Babil Mound at Babylon, the site of the

</div>

<p>The etymology of the name of Babel from <i>balbel</i>,
“to confound,” suggested in Genesis is one of those
“popular etymologies” or plays on words of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the Old Testament writers are so fond. Thus, for
instance, the name of Joseph is connected first with
<i>’âsaph</i> “to take away,” and then with <i>yâsaph</i> “to
add” (Gen. xxx. 23, 24.), and the name of the
Moabite city Dibon is changed into Dimon by Isaiah
(xv. 9) to indicate that its “waters shall be full of
blood,” Hebrew <i>dâm</i>. Babel is the Assyrian <i>Bab-ili</i>
“the gate of God” (or, as it is occasionally written
in the plural, <i>Bab-ili</i> “Gate of the gods”), which was
the Semitic translation of the old Accadian name of
the town Ca-dimirra with the same meaning. This
is not the only instance in which the original
Accadian names of Babylonian cities were literally
translated into Semitic Babylonian after the Semitic
conquest of the country. It is possible that the
name had some reference to the building of the
Tower. Babylon was first made a capital by Khammuragas,
the leader of the Cossæan dynasty, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
position which it never afterwards lost; but the first
antediluvian king of Chaldea, Alorus, according to
Barosus, was a native of the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tower in Stages, from an Assyrian Bas-relief.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The actual site of the Tower of Babel, beyond the
mere fact that it was somewhere in Babylon, has not
yet been settled. It is generally considered to be represented
by the great pile of Birs Nimrud, which
stood in Borsippa, the suburb of Babylon, and was
dedicated to Nebo and called “the Temple of the
Seven Lights” or planets. This ruin has been
examined by Sir Henry Rawlinson; details of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
operations here are given in the “Journal of the
Royal Asiatic Society,” vol. xviii., and Rawlinson’s
“Ancient Monarchies,” p. 544. Sir Henry discovered
by excavation that the tower consisted of
seven stages of brickwork on an earthen platform,
each stage being of a different colour. This is explained
by the fact that it was devoted to the seven
planets. The height of the earthen platform was not
ascertained, but the first stage, which was an exact
square, was 272 feet each way, and 26 feet high, the
bricks being blackened with bitumen; this stage is
supposed to have been dedicated to the planet
Saturn. The second stage was a square of 230
feet, 26 feet high, faced with orange-coloured bricks;
supposed to have been dedicated to Jupiter. The
third stage, 188 feet square, and 26 feet high,
faced with red bricks, was probably dedicated to
Mars. The fourth stage, 146 feet square, and 15 feet
high, was probably dedicated to the Sun, and is
thought by Sir H. Rawlinson to have been originally
plated with gold. The fifth stage is supposed to have
been 104, the sixth 62, and the seventh 20 feet square,
but the top was too ruinous to decide these measurements.
These stages were probably dedicated to
Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. Each stage of the
building was not set in the centre of the stage on
which it rested, but was placed 30 feet from the front,
and 12 feet from the back. The ruin at present rises
154 feet above the level of the plain, and is the
most imposing pile in the whole country. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
to Nebuchadnezzar it had been built to the height of
42 cubits by “a former king,” who however had not
completed its summit, and it had long been in a
ruinous condition when Nebuchadnezzar undertook
to restore and finish it. Prof. Schrader imagines
that the long period during which it had remained
an unfinished ruin caused the growth of the legend
which saw in it a monument of the overthrow of
human presumption, the diversity of languages in
Babylonia being sufficient to account for the localization
of the confusion of tongues in the country.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Rawlinson now proposes to place the
Tower or <i>tul ellu</i> at the ruins now called Amrán,
within the city of Babylon itself. Here he thinks
were the temple of Anu, on the site of the ruined
Tower, a chapel dedicated to Nebo, an altar of Merodach,
the royal palace (now represented by the mound
of the Kasr), and the hanging gardens, all enclosed by
a common wall. The quarter of Babylon thus enclosed
he would identify with the Calneh of the Bible,
principally on the ground that the Septuagint rendering
of Isaiah x. 9 is, “Have I not taken the region above
Babylon and Chalanne where the tower was built?”</p>

<p>A third site has been claimed for the Tower on the
Babil or Mujellibeh mound on the north side of Babylon.
This represents the famous temple of Belus or
Bel, whose great festival marked the beginning of the
year and the vernal equinox. But there is no evidence
to support this third opinion.</p>

<p>In the Babylonian and Assyrian sculptures there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
are occasionally representations of towers similar in
style to the supposed Tower of Babel; one of these
is given on the stone of Merodach Baladan I., opposite
p. 236 of Mr. Smith’s “Assyrian Discoveries;”
another occurs on the sculptures at Nineveh, representing
the city of Babylon; this tower, however,
cannot represent the Borsippa pile, since it consists of
only five stages.</p>

<p>Besides the Tower of Babel, the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah by fire from heaven may also
have been known to the Accadians. We learn from
Genesis xiv. that the cities of the plain were among
the conquests of Chedor-laomer and his allies, and
there is some reason for thinking that the history of
Chedor-laomer’s campaign may have been derived
from the Babylonian state archives. At all events
Amraphel or Amarpel, the king of Sumir, is mentioned
first, although Chedor-laomer was the paramount
sovereign and the leader of the expedition. The
expedition must have taken place during the period
when, as we learn from the inscriptions, Babylonia
was subject to the monarchs of Elam, though subordinate
princes were ruling over the states into which it
was divided at the time. Though the name of Chedor-laomer
has not been found, Laomer or Lagamar
appears as an Elamite god, and several of the Elamite
kings bore names compounded with Kudur “a servant,”
as Kudur-Nankhunte, “the servant of the god
Nankhunte,” Kudur-Mabug, “the servant of Mabug,”
and the like. Arioch, king of Ellasar, which probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
stands for al Larsa, “the city of Larsa,” has the same
name as Eri-Acu (“the servant of the moon-god”),
the son of the Elamite monarch Kudur-Mabug, who
reigned over Larsa during his father’s lifetime, and
was eventually overthrown by the Cossæan conqueror
Khammuragas.</p>

<p>The text which perhaps relates to the destruction
of the guilty cities is a bilingual one, much mutilated,
and runs as follows:—</p>

<ul><li>1. An overthrow came from the midst of the
deep (the waters above the firmament).</li>

<li>2. The fated punishment from the midst of heaven
descended.</li>

<li>3. A storm like a plummet the earth (overwhelmed).</li>

<li>4. Towards the four winds the destroying flood
like fire burnt.</li>

<li>5. The inhabitants of the city it had caused to be
tormented; their bodies it consumed.</li>

<li>6. In city and country it spread death, and the
flames as they rose overthrew.</li>

<li>7. Freeman and slave were equal, and the high
places it filled.</li>

<li>8. In heaven and earth like a thunderstorm it
had rained; a prey it made.</li>

<li>9. To a place of refuge the gods hastened, and in
a throng collected.</li>

<li>10. Its mighty (onset) they fled from, and like a
garment it concealed (the guilty).</li>

<li>11. They (feared), and death (overtook them).</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></li>

<li>12. (Their) feet and hands (it embraced).</li>

<li>13. ..........</li>

<li>14. Their body it consumed.</li>

<li>15. ..... as for the city, its foundations it defiled.</li>

<li>16. .... with (glory?) and breadth his mouth he
filled.</li>

<li>17. This man the voice (of the thunder) called; the
thunderbolt descended;</li>

<li>18. during the day it flashed; grievously (it fell).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the fragment breaks off. It is possible that
the person referred to in line 17 was the pious man
who like Lot escaped the destruction that befell his
neighbours.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">We</span> now come to the great Epic of early
Chaldea, first discovered by Mr. Smith
in 1872. The hero of this Epic is provisionally
called Izdubar, though this is
certainly not the right reading of his name. The first
and last characters which compose it together form a
compound ideograph signifying “fire,” and pronounced
<i>gibil</i> in Accadian, <i>isatu</i> in Assyrian, while the middle
character, <i>dhu</i> or <i>dhun</i>, meant “a mass” or “a going.”
“A mass of fire” would have been by no means an
inappropriate name for a hero, who, as we shall see,
was originally the Accadian fire-god, and then a per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>sonified
form of the sun-god. The two last characters
of the name, however, when used as a compound ideograph,
denoted “the under-lip,” and the first character
symbolizes “wood.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith believed that Izdubar was the Biblical
Nimrod, and was almost inclined to think that this
was the way in which the name ought to be phonetically
rendered. One passage, however, in which the
last syllable is followed by the syllable <i>ra</i> seems to
imply that the final letter was <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>The originally solar character of the hero was still
remembered at the time when the great Epic of the
Accadians was put together. As was pointed out by
Sir Henry Rawlinson shortly after Mr. Smith’s first
discovery of it, it is arranged upon an astronomical
principle, its twelve books or tablets corresponding
with the twelve signs of the Zodiac, through which
the sun passes in his yearly course. Thus the eleventh
tablet, which contains the episode of the Deluge,
answers to Aquarius the eleventh sign of the Zodiac,
and the eleventh month of the Accadian year called
“the rainy;” and the sixth tablet, describing his
courtship by Istar, answers to Virgo the sixth sign of
the Zodiac, and the sixth Accadian month called that
“of the errand of Istar.” It is in the second month,
that of “the directing bull,” and under the sign of
Taurus, that Hea-bani, half-man, half-bull, is brought
to Izdubar in the second tablet; the lion is slain by
Izdubar under the Zodiacal Leo, and the lamentation
he makes over the corpse of his friend and seer Hea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>-bani
is made in “the dark month” of Adar, as it was
termed, at the end of the year. Like the autumnal
sun, too, Izdubar sickens in the eighth book corresponding
with the month of October, and only recovers
his health and brilliance after bathing in the waters of
the eastern ocean at the beginning of the new year.</p>

<p>If anything were needed to confirm the solar character
of Izdubar and his history, it would be afforded
by a comparison with the legends of the Greek solar
hero, Herakles. Like much else of Greek mythology,
the twelve adventures of Herakles were brought to
Greece from Babylonia through the hands of the
Phœnicians, and it has long been recognized that
Herakles is but a form of Baal Melkarth, the sun-god
of Tyre. Hea-bani reappears in Cheiron, the centaur,
the friend and instructor of Herakles, and just as Hea-bani
was created by Hea, Cheiron was said to be the
son of Kronos, who is identified by Berosus with Hea
in the account of the Deluge. The lion slain by
Izdubar is the lion of Nemea slain by Herakles; the
winged bull made by Anu is the famous bull of Krete;
the tyrant Khumbaba is the tyrant Geryon; the gems
borne by the trees of the forest beyond the gateway
of the sun are the apples of the Hesperides; and the
deadly sickness of Izdubar himself is but the fever of
Herakles, caused by the poisoned tunic of Nessus.</p>

<p>A very slight inspection of the Epic is sufficient to
show that it has been pieced together out of a number
of previously existing and independent materials.
Thus the history of the Deluge, which is itself but an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
episode somewhat violently foisted into the legend of
Izdubar in order to preserve the astronomical
arrangement of the Epic, may be shown to have consisted
of at least two older poems on the subject; and
a careful examination of other portions of the Epic
brings the same fact to light elsewhere.</p>

<p>As, however, there is clear proof that the Epic was
originally composed in Accadian, our present text
being merely the Semitic translation of the Accadian
original, it must have existed in the form in which we
now have it before the age of Sargon and the extinction
of the Accadian language in Chaldea. We shall
not be far wrong, therefore, in ascribing its composition
to about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2000, or a little earlier. The older lays
or poems out of which it was formed must therefore
date before this period. There seems to have been a
considerable number of them, each incident in the
cycle of ancient Accadian mythology having been the
subject of various poems. Many of these originated
in different parts of the country, so that a long period
of time must be allowed for their growth and subsequent
reduction to a literary form. But as the legends
they celebrated were traditions in the country before
they were embodied in poems and committed to
writing, we must go back to quite a remote epoch for
their first starting-point.</p>

<p>The earliest evidence we have of them is in the
carvings on early Babylonian cylindrical seals.
Among the earliest known devices on these seals we
have scenes from the legends of Izdubar, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the story of the Creation. The seals mostly belong
to the age of the kings of Ur, and some of them are
a good deal older than <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2000. The principal
incidents represented on them are the struggles of
Izdubar and his companion Hea-bani with the lion
and the bull, the journey of Izdubar in search of
Xisuthrus, Noah or Xisuthrus in his ark, and the
war between Tiamtu the sea-dragon and the god
Merodach. There is a fragment of a document in
the British Museum which claims to be copied from
an omen tablet belonging to the time of Izdubar
himself, but it is probably not earlier than <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1600,
when many similar tablets were written.</p>

<p>There is an incidental notice of the ship or ark of
“the god Izdubar” in a tablet printed in “Cuneiform
Inscriptions,” vol. ii. p. 46. He is here called “the
king who bears the sceptre.” This tablet, which contains
lists of wooden objects, was written in the time
of Assur-bani-pal, but is copied from an original, which
must have been written at least eighteen hundred
years before the Christian era. The geographical
notices on this tablet suit the period before the rise
of Babylon. Surippak is called in it the ship or ark
city, this name forming another reference to the Flood
legends. Izdubar is also mentioned in a series of
tablets relating to witchcraft, and on a tablet containing
prayers to him as a god; this last showing that
he was deified, which, however, was an honour also
given to several Babylonian kings.</p>

<p>As already stated, the legends of Izdubar are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>scribed
on twelve tablets, of which there are remains
of at least four editions. All the tablets are in fragments,
and none of them are complete; but it is a
fortunate circumstance that the most perfect tablet is
the eleventh, which describes the Deluge, this being
the most important of the series. In the first chapter
the successive steps in the discovery of these legends
have been already described, and we may now therefore
pass on to the description and translation of
the various fragments. All the fragments of our
present copies belong to the reign of Assur-bani-pal,
king of Assyria, in the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> From
the mutilated condition of many of them it is impossible
at present to gain an accurate idea of the
whole scope of the legends, and many parts which
are lost have to be supplied by conjecture; the
order even of some of the tablets cannot be determined,
and it is uncertain if we have fragments of
the whole twelve in what follows. Mr. Smith
has, however, conjecturally divided the fragments into
groups corresponding roughly with the subjects of
the tablets. Each tablet when complete contained six
columns of writing, and each column had generally
from forty to fifty lines of writing, there being
in all about 3,000 lines of cuneiform text. The
divisions adopted by Mr. Smith will be seen by the
following summary, which exhibits our present knowledge
of the fragments.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tablet I.</span></h3>

<p>The opening words of the first tablet are preserved,
and form as usual the title of the series, but
the expressions used are obscure from want of any
context to explain them. There are two principal or
key-words, <i>naqbi</i> and <i>kugar</i>; the first of which means
“a channel,” and is more particularly applied to the
canals with which Babylonia was intersected and
watered, while the second is the compound ideograph
which literally signifies “minister” or “servant of
work.” It was the special title of Izdubar, who, like
his Greek double Herakles, was celebrated for ‘the
twelve labours’ he successfully undertook. The
title had no doubt been originally given to the fire-god,
in whom primitive man sees his most useful servant
and workman. The first line of the Epic would
consequently have run: “The canals, the toiling
hero, the god Izdubar, had seen.” Elsewhere, however,
the title of Izdubar is written <i>Zicar</i>, that is,
“the male” or “hero.”</p>

<p>After the heading and opening line there is a
considerable blank in the story, two columns of
writing being entirely lost. It is probable that this
part contained the account of the parentage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
previous history of Izdubar, forming the introduction
to the story. In the subsequent portions of the
history there is very little information to supply the
loss of this part of the inscription; but it appears
that the mother of Izdubar was named Dannat,
which signifies “the powerful lady.” His father is
not named in any of our present fragments, but he is
referred to in the third tablet. He was no doubt a
deity, possibly the Sun-god, who is supposed to interfere
very much in his behalf. When Izdubar, the
old god of fire, after first becoming a form of the
solar deity, was finally personified and regarded as a
mighty leader, strong in war and hunting, he was
turned into a giant, one of the mythical monarchs
who had ruled in Babylonia in long-past days, and
had subdued the many petty kingdoms into which the
valley of the Euphrates was then divided.</p>

<p>The centre of the empire of Izdubar is laid in
the region of Shinar, or Sumir, Erech “the lofty”
being the chief seat of his power, and thus agrees
with the site of the kingdom of Nimrod, according to
Genesis x. 8, 9, 10, where we read: “And Cush begat
Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore
it is said, even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before
the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was
Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the
land of Shinar.” We cannot overlook the fact that
the character of Izdubar as hunter, leader, and king,
corresponds with that of Nimrod. Cush, the father of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Nimrod, may be identified with Cusu, Cusi or Cus, the
Accadian deity of sunset and night. The word in Accadian
signified “rest” and “darkness,” and is translated
by the Assyrian <i>nakhu</i> “to rest,” and <i>nukhu</i> or
<i>nukh</i> “rest.” This latter word is identical with the
Biblical Noah. It is very possible, therefore, that
Cush, the father of Nimrod, has nothing to do with
Cush or Ethiopia, the son of Ham, the two being set
side by side in Genesis merely on account of the similarity
of their names. In this case all the ethnological
difficulties occasioned by the belief that the Accadians
of Babylonia were Cushites, and connected with Egypt
or Ethiopia, will be avoided. It is curious to find the
Christian writers identifying Nimrod with Evechous,
the first king of Babylon, according to Berosus, after
the flood.</p>

<p>The next passage in Genesis after the one describing
Nimrod’s dominion may also refer to Nimrod,
if we read with the margin, “Out of that land he
went forth to Assyria,” instead of “Out of that land
went forth Assur.” These verses will then read
(Genesis x. 11, 12): “Out of that land he went forth
to Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and the suburbs of
the city, and Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and
Calah: the same is a great city.” It must be remembered,
however, that Assur was regarded by the
Assyrians as their supreme god and eponymous
founder, and that in Micah v. 6, “the land of Assur”
and “the land of Nimrod” seem to be contrasted with
one another. But it is possible to consider the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
expressions in the latter passage to be both applied
to the same country.</p>

<p>After the date of the later books of the Old Testament
we know nothing of Nimrod for some time; it
is probable that he was fully mentioned by Berosus
in his history, but his account of the giant hunter has
been lost. The reason of this appears to be, that a
belief had grown up among early Christian writers
that the Biblical Nimrod was the first king of Babylonia
after the Flood, and looking at the list of Berosus
they found that after the Flood according to him
Evechous first reigned in Babylonia, and at once
assumed that the Evechous of Berosus was the Nimrod
of the Bible; but as Evechous has given to him
the extravagant reign of four ners or 2,400 years,
and his son and successor, Chomasbelus, four ners
and five sosses, or 2,700 years, this identification gives
little hope of our finding an historical Nimrod.</p>

<p>It is possible that this identification of Nimrod
with Evechous, made by the early chronologists,
has caused them to overlook his name and true
epoch in the list of Berosus, and has thus lost to us
his position in the series of Babylonian sovereigns.</p>

<p>Belonging to the first centuries of the Christian
era are the works of various Jewish and Christian
writers, who have made us familiar with a number of
later traditions concerning Nimrod. Josephus declares
that he was a prime mover in building the Tower of
Babel, an enemy of God, and that he reigned at
Babylon during the dispersion. Later writers make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
him a contemporary with Abraham, the inventor of
idol worship, and a furious worshipper of fire. At
the city of Orfa, in Syria, he is said to have cast
Abraham into a burning fiery furnace because he
would not bow down to his idols. These legends
have been taken up by the Arabs, and although his
history has been lost and replaced by absurd and
worthless stories, Nimrod still remains the most prominent
name in the traditions of the country; everything
good or evil is attributed to him, and the most
important ruins are even now called after his name.
From the time of the early Christian writers down
to to-day, men have been busy framing systems of
general chronology, and since Nimrod was always
known as a famous sovereign it was necessary to
find a definite place for him in each chronological
scheme. Africanus and Eusebius held that he was
the Evechous of Berosus, and reigned first after the
Flood. Moses of Khorene identified him with Bel,
the great god of Babylon; and he is said to have
extended his dominions to the foot of the Armenian
mountains, falling in battle there when attempting
to enforce his authority over Haic, king of Armenia.
Other writers identified Nimrod with Ninus, the
mythical founder of the city of Nineveh. These
remained the principal identifications before modern
research took up the matter; but so wide a door was
open to conjecture, that one writer actually identified
Nimrod with the Alorus of Berosus, the first king
of Babylonia <i>before</i> the Flood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>One of the most curious theories about Nimrod,
suggested in modern times, was grounded on the
“Book of Nabatean Agriculture.” This work is a
comparatively modern forgery, pretending to be a
literary production of the early Chaldean period.
In this work Nimrod heads a list of Babylonian kings
called <i>Canaanite</i>, and a writer in the “Journal of
Sacred Literature” has argued with considerable force
in favour of these Canaanites being the Arabs of Berosus,
who reigned about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1550 to 1300. The
southern half of Arabia is known as Cush in the Old
Testament like the opposite coast of Africa, and, as
Nimrod is called a Cushite in Genesis, there was a
great temptation to identify him with the leader
of the Arab dynasty. This idea, however, gained
little favour, and has not been held by any section
of inquirers as fixing the position of Nimrod.
The discovery of the cuneiform inscriptions threw a
new light on the subject of Babylonian history, and
soon after the decipherment of the inscriptions attention
was directed to the question of the identity and
age of Nimrod. Sir Henry Rawlinson, the father
of Assyrian discovery, first seriously attempted to
fix the name of Nimrod in the cuneiform inscriptions,
and he endeavoured to find the name in that
of the second god of the great Chaldean triad. (See
Rawlinson’s “Ancient Monarchies,” vol. i. p. 117.)
The names of this deity are really Enu, Elum, and
Bel, and he was evidently worshipped at the dawn of
Babylonian history, and is in fact represented as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
of the creators of the world; time, moreover, has
shown that the cuneiform characters on which the
identification was grounded do not bear the phonetic
values then supposed.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Rawlinson also suggested (“Ancient
Monarchies,” p. 136) that the god Nergal was a deification
of Nimrod. Nergal, however, which means
literally “the illuminator of Hades,” was a god of the
lower world, and even if Nimrod was deified under
the name of Nergal this does not explain his position
or epoch.</p>

<p>Canon Rawlinson, brother of Sir Henry, in the
first volume of his “Ancient Monarchies,” p. 153,
and following, makes some judicious remarks on the
chronological position of Nimrod, and suggests that
he may have reigned a century or two before <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
2286; he asserts the historical character of his reign,
and supposes him to have founded the Babylonian
monarchy, but does not himself identify him with
any king known from the inscriptions. At the time
when this was written (1871), the conclusions of
Canon Rawlinson were the most satisfactory that
had been advanced since the discovery of the cuneiform
inscriptions. Since this time, however, some
new theories have been started, with the idea of
identifying Nimrod; one of these, brought forward
by Professor Oppert, makes the word a geographical
term, but such an explanation is evidently quite
insufficient to account for the traditions attached to
the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>Another theory brought forward by the Rev. A.
H. Sayce and Josef Grivel, “Transactions of Society
of Biblical Archæology,” vol. ii. part 2, p. 243, and vol.
iii. part 1, p. 136, identifies Nimrod with Merodach,
the god of Babylon; partly on the ground of the
similarity of name, Merodach being Amar-utuci or
Amar-ud in Accadian, partly because Merodach the
patron-deity of Babylon stood in the same relation to
that city that Asshur did to Assyria (see Micah v. 6),
and partly since we find Merodach called “a hero”
like Nimrod in Genesis, and assigned “four divine
dogs” as though he were a hunter. These dogs are
Uccumu “the despoiler,” Acculu “the devourer,”
Icsuda “the capturer,” and Iltebu “the carrier away.”
Merodach, it must be remembered, is always represented
as a man, and is armed with weapons of
war.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith first fancied that Nimrod might be
Khammuragas, whom he identified with the first
Arab king of Berosus, as this line of kings appeared
to be connected with the Cossæans. This identification
failing, after the discovery of the Deluge tablet in
1872, he conjectured that the hero whose name is
provisionally read Izdubar is the Nimrod of the
Bible, a conjecture which has since been adopted by
several other scholars.</p>

<p>The supposition that Nimrod was an ethnic or
geographical name, which was at one time favoured
by Sir Henry Rawlinson, and has since been urged
by Professor Oppert, is quite untenable, for it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
be impossible on this theory to account for certain
features in what we are told of the hero.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith’s opinion that he was the hero of the
Izdubar Epic was first founded on the discovery that
the latter formed the centre of the national historical
poetry, and was the hero of Babylonian legend—in
fact, occupies much the same place as Nimrod in later
Arab tradition.</p>

<p>Izdubar, moreover, agrees <i>exactly</i> in character with
Nimrod; he was a hunter, according to the cuneiform
legends, who contended with and destroyed the lion,
tiger, leopard, and wild bull or buffalo, animals the
most formidable in the chase in any country. He
ruled first in Babylonia over the region which from
other sources we know to have been the centre of
Nimrod’s kingdom. The principal scene, too, of his
exploits and triumphs was the city of Erech, which,
according to Genesis, was the second capital of
Nimrod.</p>

<p>There remains the fact that the cuneiform name of
this hero is undeciphered, the name Izdubar being a
mere makeshift. It is possible that when the phonetic
reading of the characters is found it will turn out to
correspond with the name Nimrod. At all events it
is noteworthy that Izdubar seems to have been specially
connected with the town of Marad, the original
Accadian name of which was Amarda, and that the
Accadian <i>an Amarda</i> or “god of Amarda,” closely
corresponds with the Biblical name of Nimrod. The
translations and notes given in this book will lead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
perhaps, to the general admission of the identity of
the hero Izdubar with the traditional Nimrod; but
this result can be firmly established only when more
evidence is before us than that which we have at
present.</p>

<p>At the time of the opening of the Epic, the great
city of the south of Babylonia, and the capital of this
part of the country, was Uruk, called in Genesis,
Erech. Erech was devoted to the worship of Anu,
the god of heaven, and his wife, the goddess Anatu,
as well as of Istar, the Phœnician Ashtoreth, or
Astarte, the myth of whose love for the Sun-god
Dumuzi or Tammuz, the Adonis of Greek story, is
alluded to in the course of the poem. The worship
of Anatu, however, was subsequent to the Semitic
occupation of the country, since the necessity of providing
a female deity by the side of every male one
was not felt until the Accadians, whose language was
unacquainted with genders, were succeeded by the Semites
with their nouns either masculine or feminine.</p>

<p>Here may provisionally be placed the first fragment
of the Izdubar legends, K 3200. This fragment consists
of part of the third column of a tablet, which is
probably the first; and it gives an account of a
conquest of Erech by its enemies. The fragment
reads:—</p>

<ul><li>1. his ..... he left</li>

<li>2. ....... and he goes down to the river,</li>

<li>3. .... in the river his ship is made good.</li>

<li>4. .... he is .... and he weeps bitterly</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></li>

<li>5. .... placed, the city of Ganganna which had
(suffered) destruction.</li>

<li>6. .... their <i>samuri</i> (were) she asses</li>

<li>7. .... their <i>raburi</i> (were) great wild bulls.</li>

<li>8. Like cattle the people fears,</li>

<li>9. like doves the slaves mourn.</li>

<li>10. The gods of Erech the lofty</li>

<li>11. turned to flies and brood in swarms.</li>

<li>12. The spirits (<i>sedu</i>) of Erech the lofty</li>

<li>13. turned to cocks and went forth in outposts.</li>

<li>14. For three years the city of Erech does the
enemy besiege,</li>

<li>15. the great gates were thrown down and trampled
upon,</li>

<li>16. the goddess Istar before its enemies could
not lift her head.</li>

<li>17. Bel his mouth opened and speaks,</li>

<li>18. to Istar the queen a speech he makes:</li>

<li>19. ..... in the midst of Nipur my hands
have placed,</li>

<li>20. .... my country? Babylon (Din-tir) the
house of my delight,</li>

<li>21. my .... I gave my hands.</li>

<li>22. ..... he was favourable to the sanctuaries</li>

<li>23. ..... in the day ....</li>

<li>24. ..... the great gods. ....</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have a graphic account of the condition
of Erech, when the enemy overran the country, and
the first question which occurs is, who were these
conquerors? Conjecture is idle in the want of evi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>dence.
They may have been the Semitic successors
of the Accadians, they may have been the Medes of
Berosus, or they may have been tribes who belong
only to the realm of mythology. Mr. Smith believed
that they were the subjects of Khumbaba, the tyrant
whose death is related in the fourth book of the Epic,
and who ruled over the land of Elam.</p>

<p>The name of Khumbaba, or Khubaba, as it is
occasionally written, is probably a compound of
“Khumba,” or “Khumbume,” the name of one of
the chief Elamite gods. Many other Elamite names
compounded with Khumba are mentioned in the
inscriptions: Khumba-sidir, an early chief; Khumba-undasa,
an Elamite general opposed to Sennacherib;
Khumba-nigas, an Elamite monarch opposed to Sargon;
Tul-khumba, an Elamite city, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The notice of foreign dominion, and particularly
of Elamite supremacy at this time, may, perhaps,
form a clue from which to ascertain the approximate
age of the poems as we have them. We know that
myths are localized in the country of those who hand
them down to posterity, and assigned to an age which
has made an impression on their narrators. There
must have been some reason for the legendary siege
and capture of Erech, some actual event around which
the story of Izdubar has entwined itself.</p>

<p>Looking at the fragments of Berosus and the notices
of Greek and Roman authors, we may ask
whether there is any epoch of conquest and foreign
dominion which can be fixed upon as representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
such an actual event? Let us glance for a moment
at the earlier history of Babylonia so far as it is known
to us.</p>

<p>The earlier part of the list of dynasties quoted from
Berosus gives the following periods from the Flood
downwards:—</p>

<p class="hang">86 Chaldean kings from the Flood down to the
Median conquest, reigning for 34,080 or 33,091
years.</p>

<p class="hang">8 Median kings who conquered and held Babylon,
234, or 224, or 190 years.</p>

<p class="hang">11 other kings, race and duration unknown.</p>

<p class="hang">49 Chaldean kings, for 458 years.</p>

<p>The last of these dynasties preceded a dynasty of
kings called Arabian by the copyists of Berosus, and
though neither the number of the reigns nor the
length of time assigned to the dynasty agrees with
what the monuments tell us of the Cassite or Cossæan
line of kings, there is no other line which can in any
way be identified with the Arabians of the Babylonian
historian. The 49 Chaldean kings must, therefore,
have reigned before Khammuragas, that is before <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
2000-1750. Now an inscription of Nabonidus informs
us that Lig-bagas, the first monarch of all
Chaldea of whom we know, flourished 700 years anterior
to the reign of Khammuragas; he would, therefore,
come among the 11 nameless kings of Berosus, supposing
any reliance can be placed on the statements
of the latter, and about 250 years before the accession
of the Chaldean dynasty. But the engraved cylinders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
and seals of the age of Lig-bagas show that the legend
of Izdubar was already popular, and we must accordingly
seek a still older period in which to place its
origin and attachment to a particular historical event.
Hence it may well be that the siege of Erech, the
memory of which is preserved in the first book of the
Izdubar Epic, was the work of those foreign invaders
whom the Babylonian historian has termed Median.</p>

<p>Now it is not improbable that the Median dynasty
was really Elamite; or at all events belonged to the
same race as the primitive inhabitants of Elam.
This race was closely allied to the Accadians; and it
was spread over the whole range of country which
stretched from the southern shores of the Caspian to
the Persian Gulf. The Protomedes, as they are
sometimes called, were not conquered and supplanted
by Aryan invaders from the east till the ninth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> It was in their country that Kharsak-kurra,
“the Mountain of the East,” was localized whereon
the Accadians and their kinsfolk in Elam and Media
believed the ark to have rested after the Flood, and
which they regarded as the cradle of their race. It
was therefore pre-eminently “the land,” <i>mada</i> in
Accadian, and from this <i>mada</i> there is every reason
to think the name of Media has been derived. Consequently,
the Medians of Berosus, the inhabitants of
<i>mada</i> “the land” of the east, need not have been
more than one of the many Elamite swarms that
from time to time descended into the fertile plains of
Babylonia, and not unfrequently obtained a settlement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
there. Such were the Accadians, or “Highlanders”
themselves; such, too, the two Cassite or Cossæan
dynasties which we learn from the monuments long
held sway over Chaldea.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Migration of Eastern Tribe; from early Babylonian Cylinder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>An early Babylonian cylinder, which came from
Erech and originally belonged to a member of the
royal family of that city, presents us with a curious
picture of a rude nomad tribe apparently arriving in
Babylonia. The chief marches in front armed with
bow and arrows, and wearing the same kind of boots
with turned-up ends as distinguished the Hittites in
ancient times and are still worn in Asia Minor and
Greece. They indicate that the wearer came from a
cold and mountainous country. The animals’ skins
which compose the dresses of his three retainers also
point to a similar conclusion. Besides the retainers,
the wife of the chief is depicted, as well as two slaves
who carry some objects on their shoulders. Unfortunately
no light is cast upon the group by the inscription,
which simply states that the cylinder belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
to “Gibil-dur (or Ne-Zicum), the brother of the
king of Erech, the librarian, thy servant.” All we
can gather from it is that the famous library of Erech,
which furnished Assur-bani-pal and his scribes with
the original texts of the Izdubar Epic, was already in
existence, and that the office of librarian was considered
honourable enough to be borne by a brother
of the reigning monarch.</p>

<p>If the legendary siege of Erech is not to be referred
to the epoch of the Median conquest, it may have
fallen at the time when the image of the goddess
Nana was carried away from Erech by the Elamite
king Kudur-nankhundi, 1635 years before the capture
of Shushan, the capital of Elam, by the Assyrians
(about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 645), and consequently about
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2280. A fragment which refers to this period in
“Cuneiform Inscriptions,” vol. iii. p. 38, relates the
destruction wrought in the country by the Elamites,
and makes Kudur-nankhundi follow one of the other
monarchs of an Elamite dynasty and exceed his predecessors
in the injury he did to the country.</p>

<p>Putting together the detached notices of this
period, the following may approximately represent
the chronology, the dates being understood as round
numbers.</p>

<p>? <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2750, Elamites (Medes) overrun Babylonia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2280, Kudur-nankhundi, king of Elam, ravages
Erech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1800, Khammuragas conquers Babylonia.</p>

<p>Although the dates transmitted through ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
authors are as a rule vague and doubtful, there are
many independent notices which seem to point to
somewhere about the twenty-third century before
the Christian era for the foundation of the Babylonian
and Assyrian power. Several of these dates
are connected either directly or by implication with
Nimrod, who first formed a united empire over these
regions.</p>

<p>The following are some of these notices:—</p>

<p>Simplicius relates that Callisthenes, the friend of
Alexander, sent to Aristotle from Babylon a series of
stellar observations reaching back 1,903 years before
the taking of Babylon by Alexander. This would
make 1903 + 331 = <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2234.</p>

<p>Berosus and Critodemus are said by Pliny to have
made the inscribed stellar observations reach to 480
years before the era of Phoroneus; as the latter date
was supposed to be about the middle of the eighteenth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, 480 years before it comes also to about
the period of Kudur-nankhundi.</p>

<p>Diodorus makes the Assyrian empire commence a
thousand years or more before the Trojan war.</p>

<p>Ctesias and Cephalion make its foundation early
in the twenty-second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The two last statements, however, are probably derived
from Ctesias, whose so-called history has been
shown by cuneiform decipherment to have been a
mere fiction put together out of misunderstood myths
and fragments of theology. In any case, too, they
apply only to the foundation of the Assyrian power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
which was modern as compared with that of Babylonia,
in spite of the assertion of Sargon, who boasts
of having been preceded on the throne by 350
kings.</p>

<p>Of the latter part of the first tablet of the Izdubar
Epic we have as yet no knowledge.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> this chapter are included the fragments
of what appear to be the second and
third tablets or books. In this section of
the story Izdubar comes prominently forward,
and meets with Hea-bani. The notice of his
mother Dannat appears in one of the tablets given
in this chapter.</p>

<p>Izdubar, in the Babylonian and Assyrian sculptures,
is always represented with a marked physiognomy,
and his peculiarities can be seen by noticing the
photograph from a Babylonian gem at the beginning
of the book, the engraving from an Assyrian sculpture
in the last chapter, and the engraving in page 249<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
showing Izdubar and Hea-bani struggling with wild
animals. In all these cases, and in every other
instance where Izdubar is represented, he is indicated
as a man with masses of curls over his head and a
large curly beard. The type is so marked and so
distinct from either the Assyrian or the Babylonian
one that it is hard to say to what race it should be attached.</p>

<p>The deity of Izdubar was Lugal-turda, the god who
was changed into the bird of storm according to the
old myth, from which it may be supposed that he was
a native of the district of Amarda or Marad, where
that god was worshipped. This district Mr. Smith
thought was probably the Amordacia or Mardocæa of
Ptolemy, but its situation is uncertain.</p>

<p>The fragments of the second and third tablets
assume by their notices that Izdubar was already
known as a mighty hunter, and it appears a little
later that he claimed descent from the old Babylonian
heroes, as he calls Xisuthrus, the Chaldean Noah, his
“father.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tablet II.</span></h3>

<p>A single fragment which Mr. Smith believed to
belong to this tablet has been found; it is K 3389,
and contains part of the third and fourth columns of
writing. It appears from this that Izdubar was
then at Erech, and had a curious dream. He thought
he saw the stars of heaven fall to the ground,
and in their descent they struck upon his back. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
then saw standing over him a terrible being, the aspect
of whose face was fierce, and who was armed with
claws, like the claws of lions. The greater part of
the description of the dream is lost; it probably
occupied Columns I. and II. of the second tablet.
Thinking that the dream portended some fate to
himself, Izdubar calls on all the wise men to explain
it, and offers a reward to any one who can interpret
the dream. Here the fragment K 3389 comes in:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column III.</span></p>

<ul><li>1. .... <i>ru kili</i> I ....</li>

<li>2. .... he and the princes may he ...</li>

<li>3. .... in the vicinity send him,</li>

<li>4. .... may they ennoble his family,</li>

<li>5. .... at the head of his feast may he set thee</li>

<li>6. .... may he array thee in jewels and gold</li>

<li>7. .... may he enclose thee</li>

<li>8. .... in his .... seat thee</li>

<li>9. into the houses of the gods may he cause thee
to enter</li>

<li>10. .... seven wives</li>

<li>11. .... cause illness in his stomach</li>

<li>12. .... went up alone</li>

<li>13. .... his heaviness to his friend</li>

<li>14. .... a dream I dreamed in my sleep</li>

<li>15. .... the stars of heaven fell to the earth</li>

<li>16. .... I stood still</li>

<li>17. .... his face</li>

<li>18. .... his face was terrible</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></li>

<li>19. .... like the claws of a lion, were his claws.</li>

<li>20. .... the strength in me</li>

<li>21. .... he slew</li>

<li>22. .... me</li>

<li>23. .... over me</li>

<li>24. .... corpse ....</li>
</ul>

<p>The first part of this fragment appears to recount
the honours offered by Izdubar to any one who should
interpret the dream. These included the ennobling
of his family, his recognition in assemblies, his
being invested with jewels of honour, and his wives
being increased. A description of the dream of
the hero, much mutilated, follows. The conduct
of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, with
reference to his dreams, bears some resemblance to
that of Izdubar.</p>

<p>After this fragment we have again a blank in the
story, and it would appear that in this interval
application was made to a nondescript creature named
Hea-bani that he would go to the city of Erech and
interpret the dream of Izdubar.</p>

<p>Hea-bani appears, from the representations on seals
and other objects on which he is figured, to have
been a satyr or faun. He is always drawn with the
feet and tail of an ox, and with horns on his head.
He is said to have lived in a cave among the wild
animals of the forest, and was supposed to possess
wonderful knowledge both of nature and human
affairs. In appearance he resembles the <i>se’irim</i> or
hairy demons, half men, half goats, who inhabited the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
deserts and were a terror to passers-by. Reference
is made to them in Lev. xvii. 7, 2 Chron. xi. 15, Is.
xiii. 21, xxxiv. 14, from which we learn that worship
was paid to them, and that they were supposed to be
specially connected with the neighbourhood of Babylon.
Hea-bani was angry at the request that he
should abandon his solitary life for the friendship of
Izdubar, and where our narrative reopens the god
Samas is persuading him to accept the offer. It may
be added that the name Hea-bani signifies “Hea
created me,” from which we may infer that the monster
was believed to have originally ascended like
Oannes out of the abysses of the sea.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column IV.</span></p>

<ul><li>1. ... me</li>

<li>2. ... on my back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

<li>3. And Samas opened his mouth</li>

<li>4. and spake and from heaven said to him:</li>

<li>5. ....  and the female Samkhat thou shalt

<li>6. they shall array thee in trappings of divinity</li>

<li>7. they shall give thee the insignia of royalty</li>

<li>8. they shall make thee become great</li>

<li>9. and Izdubar thou shalt call and incline him

<li>17. he shall clothe thy body in raiment and ....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>


<li>18. Hea-bani heard the words of Samas the warrior</li>

<li>19. and the anger of his heart was appeased</li>

<li>20. .... was appeased</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we are still dealing with the honours which
Izdubar promises to the interpreter of his dream,
and these seem to show that Izdubar had some power
at Erech at this time; he does not, however, appear
to have been an independent king, and it is probable
that the next two columns of this tablet, now lost,
contain negotiations for bringing Hea-bani to Erech,
the subject being continued on the third tablet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tablet III.</span></h3>

<p>This tablet is far better preserved than the two
previous ones; it gives the account of the successful
mission to bring Hea-bani to Erech, opening with a
broken account of the wisdom of Hea-bani.</p>

</ul>

<p>There is one other mutilated fragment of this and
the next column with part of a relation respecting
beasts and a fragment of a conversation between Izdubar
and his mother.</p>

<p>The whole of this tablet is curious, and it certainly
gives the successful issue of the attempt to bring
Hea-bani to Erech, and in very fragmentary condition
the dream of the monarch.</p>

<p>It appears that the females Samkhat and Kharimtu
prevailed upon Hea-bani to come to Erech and see the
exploits of the giant Izdubar, and he declared that he
would bring a <i>Midannu</i>, most probably a tiger, to
Erech, in order to make trial of the strength of Izdubar,
and to see if he could destroy it.</p>

<p>The Midannu is mentioned in the Assyrian texts
as a fierce carnivorous animal allied to the lion and
leopard; it is called <i>Midannu</i>, Mindinu, and Mandinu.
In a list of animals it is associated with the <i>dumamu</i>
or cat.</p>

<p>In the fifth column, after the description of the
festivities which followed the arrival of Hea-bani,
there appears a break between lines 15 and 16, some
part of the original story being probably omitted
here. The Assyrian copy probably is here de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>fective,
at least one line being lost. The portion
here omitted seems to have stated that the following
speech was made by the mother of Izdubar, who
figures prominently in the earlier part of these
legends.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> wretchedly mutilated condition of the
fragments that belong to the two next
tablets or books of the Epic makes it
impossible to ascertain their correct
order and arrangement. The arrangement given
here, accordingly, must be regarded as merely provisional.
It may, however, be taken as certain that
they all form part of the fourth and fifth tablets, and
relate the contest between Izdubar and Khumbaba.</p>

<p>Khumbaba, the Kombabos of the Greeks, was the
prototype of Geryon. He dwelt far away in the
forest of pines and sherbin cedars, where the gods
and spirits had their abode. It was, consequently, in
the cold region of the Accadian Olympus, now Mount
Elwend, that he was placed by the old mythology,
and the similarity of his name to that of the Elamite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
god Khumba or Khumbume makes it possible that
he was originally identical with the latter. In this
case the antagonism between Khumbaba and Izdubar
would have been merely a reflection of the antagonism
that existed between the inhabitants of
Babylonia and the subjects of the Elamite empire.
Mr. Smith even thought that the overthrow of Khumbaba
might have been an echo of the overthrow of
some Elamite dynasty by a Chaldean one.</p>

<p>In the case of the fourth tablet Mr. Smith believed
that he had found fragments of all six columns, but
some of these fragments are useless until we have
further fragments to complete them.</p>

<li>20. May she not return at all, may she not ...</li>

</ul>
<p class="center">(About ten lines lost here.)</p>

<p>Here we see that Izdubar, impressed with the
magnitude of the task he had undertaken, makes a
prayer and sacrifice to Samas to aid him in his task.
The next fragment appears also to belong to this
column, and may refer to preliminaries for sacrificing
to Istar, with a view also to gain her aid in the
enterprise.</p>

<p>This fragment of Column II. reads</p>

<ul><li>1. .... neighbourhood of Erech ....</li>

<li>10. the road ....</li>
</ul>

<p>Five more mutilated lines, the rest of the column
being lost.</p>

<p>This fragment shows Izdubar still invoking the
gods for his coming expedition. Under the next
column Mr. Smith placed a fragment, the position and
meaning of which are quite unknown.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column IV.—Uncertain Fragment.</span></p>

<li>10. I Hea-bani .... he lifted to ....</li>
</ul>

<p>Somewhere here should be the story, now lost, of
the starting of Izdubar on his expedition accompanied
by his friend Hea-bani. The sequel shows they
arrive at the palace or residence of Hea-bani, which
is surrounded by a forest of pine and cedar, the whole
being enclosed by some barrier or wall, with a gate
for entrance. Hea-bani and Izdubar open this gate
where the story reopens on the fifth column.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column V.</span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em">—–———–———–———–</span></li>

<li>7. Izdubar to him also [said to Hea-bani]</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we see Khumbaba waiting for the intruders,
but the rest of the column is lost; it appears to have
principally consisted of speeches by Izdubar and
Hea-bani on the magnificent trees they saw, and the
work before them. A single fragment of Column VI.,
containing fragments of six lines, shows them still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
at the gate, and when the next tablet, No. V., opens,
they had not yet entered.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tablet V.</span></h3>

<p>The fifth tablet is more certain than the last; it
appears to refer to the conquest of Khumbaba.
Only fragments of this tablet, which opens with a
description of the retreat of Khumbaba, have as yet
been discovered.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column I.</span></p>

<p>There are a few fragments of Columns III., IV.,
and V., and a small portion of Column VI., which
reads:</p>

<ul><li>1. .... cedar to ....</li>

<li>2. .... he placed and ....</li>

<li>3. .... 120 .... Hea-bani ....</li>

<li>5. .... his weapon he sharpened ....</li>

<li>6. .... tablet of the story of fate of ....</li>
</ul>

<p>It appears from the various mutilated fragments
of this tablet that Izdubar and Hea-bani conquer and
slay Khumbaba and take his goods, but much is
wanted to connect the fragments.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this stage of the story and
triumph of Izdubar are given at the commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
of the sixth tablet. The conquest of Khumbaba
gave Izdubar the crown and attributes of his fallen
rival, who seems to have been a sun-god, and this
caused Istar, who already appears as the bride of the
sun in the myth of Tammuz, to woo the triumphant
hero.</p>

<p>The seventh tablet opens with the words, “My
friend, what is this counsel the great gods are taking?”
It is uncertain if any other portion of this tablet has
been found, but part of a remarkable fragment, with
a continuation of the story of Istar, has been placed
here. It appears that the goddess, failing in her attempt
in heaven to avenge herself on Izdubar for his
slight, resolved to descend to hell, to search out, if
possible, new modes of attacking him.</p>

<p>Columns I. and II. are lost, the fragments recommencing
on Column III.</p>

her in her presence.</li>

<li>23. I will approach her and she will see me</li>

<li>24. ... and she will bring me to her</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the story is again lost, Columns V. and VI.
being absent. It would seem that Hea-bani is here
telling his friend how he must die and descend into the
house of Hades. Mr. Smith, however, thought that
in the third column some one is speaking to Istar,
trying to persuade her not to descend to Hades, while
in the fourth column the goddess, who is suffering all
the pangs of jealousy and hate, revels in the dark
details of the description of the lower regions, and
declares her determination to go there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>If this view is correct, this part of the legend would
be connected with the beautiful story of the Descent
of Istar into Hades which describes how the goddess
descended into the lower world in search of her
husband Tammuz, the Sun-god, who had been slain
by the boar’s tusk of winter. Tammuz became
Adonis, the Phœnician <i>adonai</i> “lord,” among the
Greeks, to whom the story of Aphroditê and Adonis
had been carried by the Phœnicians. The story is
one which meets us in the mythologies of many races
and nations throughout the world, and has grown in
each case out of the winter-sleep of the sun and his
resurrection in the spring. Its last echo in our own
European folklore may be heard in the tale of the
Sleeping Beauty. A calendar found among the banking
records of the Egibi firm in Babylonia notes on
the 15th day of the month Tammuz or June “an
eclipse of the Moon,” apparently in reference to the
descent of the Moon-goddess Istar into Hades. The
legend survives in a changed form in the Talmud
(<i>Yoma 69b, Sanhedrim 60a</i>). Here it is said that
after the Captivity the elders of the nation, headed
by Ezra and Nehemiah, besought God that the demon
of lust might be delivered into their hands. In spite
of a prophetic voice which warned them of the consequences
of their request, it was persisted in, and
the demon was given up to them and imprisoned.
But before three days were over, the whole course of
the world was thrown into disorder. No eggs even
were to be had, and the Jewish elders were obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
to confess their mistake and release the demon from
his fetters.</p>

<p>The descent of Istar into Hades from K 162.</p>

<li>10. Its chiefs also are like birds covered with
feathers,</li>

<li>11. over the door and bolts is scattered dust.</li>

<li>12. Istar on her arrival at the gate of Hades,</li>

<li>13. to the keeper of the gate a command she addresses:</li>

<li>14. Keeper of the waters, open thy gate,</li>

<li>15. open thy gate that I may enter.</li>

<li>16. If thou openest not the gate that I may enter,</li>

<li>17. I will strike the door, the bolts I will shatter,</li>

<li>18. I will strike the threshold and will pass through
the doors;</li>

<li>19. I will raise up the dead to devour the living,</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></li>

<li>20. above the living the dead shall exceed in numbers.</li>

<li>21. The keeper opened his mouth and speaks,</li>

<li>22. he says to the princess Istar:</li>

<li>23. Stay, lady, thou dost not glorify her,</li>

<li>24. let me go and thy name repeat to the queen
Allat.</li>

<li>25. The keeper descended and says to Allat:</li>

<li>26. This water (of life) thy sister Istar (comes to
seek).</li>

<li>27. The queen of the great vaults (of heaven) ....</li>

<li>28. Allat on hearing this says:</li>

<li>29. Like the cutting off of the herb has (Istar)
descended (into Hades),</li>

<li>30. like the lip of a deadly insect (?) she has ...</li>

<li>31. What will her heart bring me (<i>i.e.</i> matter to
me), what will her anger (bring me)?</li>

<li>32: (Istar replies:) This water with (my husband)</li>

<li>33. like food would I eat, like beer would I drink.</li>

<li>34. Let me weep over the strong who have left
their wives.</li>

<li>35. Let me weep over the handmaids who (have
lost) the embraces of their husbands.</li>

<li>36. Over the only son let me mourn, who ere his
days are come is taken away.</li>

<li>37. (Allat says:) Go keeper open thy gate to her,</li>

<li>38. bewitch her also according to the ancient rules.</li>

<li>39. The keeper went and opened his gate:</li>

<li>40. Enter, O lady, let the city of Cutha<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> receive

<li>65. Istar did not take counsel, at her she swore.</li>

<li>66. Allat her mouth opened and speaks,</li>

<li>57. with himself he adorned me; may men mourners

<li>58. on a bier place (him), and assemble the wake.</li>
</ul>

<p>This remarkable text shows Istar fulfilling her
threat and descending to Hades, but it does not appear
that she had as yet accomplished her vengeance
against Izdubar.</p>

<p>At the opening of the sixth tablet we have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
final scene of the contest with Khumbaba. Izdubar,
after slaying Khumbaba, takes the crown from the
head of the monarch and places it on his own
head, thus signifying that he assumed the empire.
There were, as we are informed in several places,
kings, lords, and princes, merely local rulers, but
these generally submitted to the greatest power;
and just as they had bowed to Khumbaba, so they
were ready now to submit to Izdubar. The kingdom
promised to Izdubar when he started to encounter
Khumbaba now became his by right of superior force,
and he entered the halls of the palace of Erech and
feasted with his heroes.</p>

<p>We are thus brought to a curious part of the story,
the romance of Izdubar and Istar. One of the strange
and dark features of the Babylonian religion was the
Istar or Venus worship, which was an adoration of
the reproductive power of nature, accompanied by
ceremonies which were a reproach to the country.
The city of Erech, originally a seat of the worship of
Anu, was now one of the foremost cities in this
Istar worship. Tammuz, the young and beautiful
Sun-god, the dead bridegroom of Istar, seems to be
also spoken of as the brother of her handmaid Kharimat.
This explains, as M. Lenormant has pointed
out, the passage in Jeremiah xxii. 18, which preserves
a portion of the wailing cry uttered by the worshippers
of Tammuz or Adonis when celebrating his untimely
death. This should be rendered:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> “Ah me, my
brother, and ah me, my sister! Ah me, Adonis, and
ah me, his lady!” Reference is made to the worship
of Tammuz, which was carried on within the Temple
itself at Jerusalem, in Ezek. viii. 14, Amos viii. 10,
(where we should translate “as at the mourning for
the only son” Tammuz), and Zech. xii. 10, 11.
Tammuz is the Semitic form of the Accadian Dumuzi
which signified in that language “the only son.”</p>

<img src="images/i_248.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bowareyeh Mound at Warka (Erech), site of the Temple of Istar.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The struggle with a bull on the part of Izdubar and
Hea-bani, represented on the Babylonian cylinder
figured on the next page, and numerous similar representations,
refer to the struggle with the bull
created by Anu to avenge the slight offered to Istar.</p>

<p>It would appear from the broken fragments of
Column IV. that Hea-bani laid hold of the bull by
the head and tail while Izdubar killed it, and Hea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>-bani
in the engraving is represented holding the bull
by its head and tail.</p>

<p>At the close of the sixth tablet the story is again
lost, only portions of the third and fourth columns
of the next tablet being preserved, but light is thrown
on this portion of the narrative by the remarkable
tablet describing the descent of Istar into Hades.
It is possible that this tablet formed an episode in
the sixth tablet of the Izdubar legends.</p>

<p>This tablet containing the descent of Istar into
Hades was first noticed by Mr. Fox Talbot in the
“Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature,”
but his attempt at a translation was a failure. Mr.
Smith subsequently published a short notice of it
in the “North British Review,” and afterwards a
translation of it in the “Daily Telegraph.” Prof.
Schrader brought out a monograph upon it in 1874,
and both M. Lenormant and Dr. Oppert have worked
at it. The most recent translation is one made into
Italian by M. Lenormant in a publication entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
“Il mito di Adone-Tammuz,” 1879, upon the basis
of the one made by Dr. Oppert.</p>

<p>The story of the descent of Istar into Hades is
one of the most beautiful myths in the Assyrian
inscriptions; it has, however, received so much attention,
and been so fully commented upon by various
scholars, that little need be said on the subject here.</p>

<p>It is evident that we are dealing with the same
goddess as the Istar, daughter of Anu, in the Izdubar
legends, although she is here called daughter of
Sin (the moon-god).</p>

<p>The description of the region of Hades is most
graphic, and vividly portrays the sufferings of the
prisoners there. Atsu-sunamir, created by Hea to
deliver Istar, is described as a composite animal,
half bitch and half man, with more than one head,
and corresponds with the two dogs of the Hindu
Rig-Veda, which have four eyes and broad snouts,
and guard the road to the abode of Yama the king
of the departed. They are also said to move among
men, feasting on their lives, as the messengers of
Yama; and as the offspring of Saramâ, the dawn,
they are called Sârameyas, which Prof. Max Müller
compares with the Greek Hermês. At any rate, the
same conception of a dog of the dawn which guards
the approach to the realm of Hades is found in the
Greek Kerberos with his fifty heads (or three heads,
according to later writers), as well as in the dog of
Geryon named Orthros or “the dawn,” who seems to
be identical with the Vedic Vritra the demon of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
night. It would appear, therefore, that in the primitive
mythology both of the Hindus and of the Accadians
the “fleet” dawn was likened to a dog,
sometimes regarded as carrying men away to the
dark under-world, sometimes as bringing light to the
under-world itself.</p>

<p>The latter part of the tablet is somewhat obscure,
but refers to the custom of lamenting for Dumuzi or
Tammuz.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Of</span> the three tablets in this section, the
first one is very uncertain, and is put
together from two separate sources:
the other two are more complete and
satisfactory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tablet VIII.</span></h3>

<p>It is again uncertain if any of this tablet has been
discovered; provisionally some fragments of the first,
second, third, and sixth columns of a tablet which
may belong to it are placed here, but the only fragment
worth translating at present is one given in Mr.
Smith’s “Assyrian Discoveries,” p. 176. In some
portions of these fragments there are references to
the story of Khumbaba, but as the fragment appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
to refer to the illness of Izdubar it probably belongs
here.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth columns of this tablet are

illness of Izdubar.</p>

</ul>

<p>It must here be noted that Mr. Smith’s grounds for
making this the eighth tablet were extremely doubtful,
and it is possible that the fragments are of different
tablets; but they fill up an evident blank in the story
here, and they are consequently inserted pending further
discoveries as to their true position.</p>

<p>In the first column Hea-bani appears to be addressing
certain trees, and they are supposed to have the
power of hearing and answering him. Hea-bani
praises one tree and sneers at another, but from the
mutilation of the text it does not appear why he acts
so. We may conjecture he was seeking a charm to open
a door he mentions, and that according to the story
this charm was known to the trees. The fragment of
the sixth column shows Hea-bani unable to interpret
a dream, while Izdubar asks his friend to fight.</p>

<p>After this happened the violent death of Hea-bani,
which added to the misfortunes of Izdubar; but no
fragment of this part of the story is preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tablet IX.</span></h3>

<p>This tablet is in a somewhat better state than the
others, and all the narrative is clearer from this point,
not a single column of the inscription being entirely
lost. The ninth tablet commences with the sorrow
of Izdubar at the death of Hea-bani.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column I.</span></p>

<ul><li>1. Izdubar over Hea-bani his friend</li>

</ul>

<p class="center">
(About eight lines lost here.)<br />
</p>

<p>The second column shows Izdubar in some fabulous
region, whither he has wandered in search of Xisuthrus.
Here he sees composite monsters with their feet
resting in Hades and their heads reaching heaven.
These beings are supposed to guide and direct the
sun at its rising and setting. This passage is as
follows:—</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column II.</span></p>

<ul><li>1. Of the mountains hearing him as many as ....</li>

<li>2. To the mountain of Masu in his course ....</li>

<li>3. who all day long guard the rising (sun).</li>

<li>4. Their crown was at the lattice of heaven,</li>

<li>5. below Hades was their footing.</li>

<li>6. Scorpion-men guard its gate,</li>

<li>7. burning with terribleness, and their appearance
was death,</li>

<li>8. the greatness of their bulk overthrows the
forests.</li>

<li>9. At the rising of the sun and the setting of the
sun, they guard the sun, and</li>

<li>10. Izdubar saw them and fear and terror seized
his face.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></li>

<li>11. He took his counsel and approached before
them.</li>

<li>12. The scorpion-man of his female asked:</li>

<li>13. Who has gone to us with his body the flesh of
the gods?</li>

<li>14. To the scorpion-man his female answered:</li>

<li>15. His going (is) that of a god, but his feeble gait
(is) that of a man.</li>

<li>16. The scorpion-man of the hero asked,</li>

<li>17. .... of the gods the word he recounts:</li>

<li>18. .... distant road</li>

<li>19. .... up to the presence</li>

<li>20. .... of which the passage is difficult.</li>

<li>21. .... thy .... thou puttest on.</li>

<li>22. .... mountains situated.</li>

<li>23. .... thou puttest on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of this column is lost. In it Izdubar
converses with the monsters, and where the third
column begins he is telling them his purpose of seeking
Xisuthrus.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column III.</span></p>

<ul><li>(1 and 2 lost.)</li>

<li>3. He Xisuthrus my father .....</li>

<li>13. to the setting sun ....</li>

<li>14. to the setting sun ....</li>

<li>15. they descended ....</li>
</ul>

<p>In this mutilated passage, the monster describes
the journey to be taken by Izdubar; there are now
many lines wanting, until we come to the fourth
column.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column IV.</span></p>

<p>This is the bottom of the fourth column; there are
five lines lost at the top of the fifth column, and then
the narrative reopens; the text is, however, mutilated
and doubtful.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Column V.</span></p>

<p>Some of the words in this fragment are obscure,
but the general meaning is clear. In the next
column the wanderings of Izdubar are continued,
and he comes to a country near the sea. Fragments
of several lines of this column are preserved, but too
mutilated to translate with certainty. The fragments
are:—</p>

<p>This tablet brings Izdubar to the region of the
sea-coast, but his way is then barred by two women,
one named Siduri and the other Sabitu. His further
adventures are given on the tenth tablet, which
opens:</p>

</ul>

<p>The rest of this column is lost, but it must have
described the meeting of Izdubar with a boatman
named Ur-Hea or Lig-Hea, called Nes-Hea “the
lion” or “dog of Hea” in Assyrian. In the second
column they commence a journey by water together
in a boat. But little of this column is preserved;
two fragments only are given here.</p>

</div>

<p>Here there is a blank, the extent of which is uncertain,
and where the narrative recommences it is
on a small fragment of the third and fourth columns
of another copy. It appears that the lost lines
record the meeting between Izdubar and a female
being named Mu-seri-ina-namari, or the “Waters of
dawn at daylight.” In the account of the Deluge,
Mu-seri-ina-namari is mentioned as bringing the
black clouds from the horizon of heaven. It was
here, beyond the circular boundary of the earth, and
on the shores of the ocean which surrounded it, that
Izdubar is now supposed to be.</p>

<p>It is curious that, whenever Izdubar speaks to this
being, the name Mua is used, while, whenever Izdubar
is spoken to, the full name Mu-seri-ina-namari
occurs. Where the story reopens Izdubar is informing
Mua of his first connection with Hea-bani
and his offers to him when he desired him to come to
Erech.</p>

<p>Here again our narrative is lost, and where we

Xisuthrus. The conversation is contained in the

<li>22. Izdubar to him also speaks, even to Xisuthrus:</li>

<li>23. Thus may I go and Xisuthrus afar off, who

<li>38. .... thy (father) and thy mother made ....</li>

<p>We now come to a fragment which forms the reverse
of the tablet already translated, and recounts
the visit of Izdubar to the two women Siduri and
Sabitu. This reads as follows:—</p>

<p>This statement closes the tenth tablet and leads to
the next question of Izdubar and its answer, which
includes the story of the Flood.</p>

<p>The present division of the legends has its own
peculiar difficulties; in the first place it does not
appear how Hea-bani was killed. Possibly he fell in
an attempt to slay a lion.</p>

<p>The land of Mas or desert of Mas over which
Izdubar travels in this tablet is the desert on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
west of the Euphrates, and the name reminds us of
the Biblical Mash who is called a son of Aram in
Genesis x. 23; on the sixth column the fragments
appear to refer to some bird with magnificent
feathers like precious stones, seen by Izdubar on his
journey.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> eleventh tablet of the Izdubar series
is the one which first attracted attention,
and is certainly the most important on
account of its containing the story of
the Flood. This tablet is the most perfect in the
series, scarcely any line being entirely lost. A new
fragment of it, belonging to another edition of the
story, has been recently brought to the museum by
Mr. Hormuzd Rassam.</p>

went, it returned, and</li>

<li>42. I sent forth a raven and it left.</li>

<li>43. The raven went, and the carrion on the water
it saw, and</li>

<li>44. it did eat, it swam, and turned away, it did
not come back.</li>

<li>45. I sent (the animals) forth to the four winds, I
sacrificed a sacrifice,</li>

<li>46. I built an altar on the peak<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> of the mountain,</li>

<li>47. by sevens vessels I placed,</li>

<li>50. the gods like flies over the sacrificer gathered.</li>

<li>51. From afar also the great goddess at her
approach</li>

<li>52. lifted up the mighty arches (<i>i.e.</i> the rainbow)
which Anu had created as his glory.</li>

<li>6. From afar also Bel at his approach</li>

<li>7. saw, the ship he stopped; Bel was filled with
anger against the gods and the spirits of heaven:</li>

<li>8. ‘Let no one come out alive, never may a man
live in the abyss.’</li>

<li>9. Ninip his mouth opened, and spake; he says to
the warrior Bel:</li>

<li>10. ‘Who is it except Hea that forms a resolution?</li>

<li>11. and Hea knows and all things he ...’</li>

<li>12. Hea his mouth opened and spake, he says to

<li>23. Again also Bel considers, (<i>literally</i>, again consideration
was considered); he approaches the midst

<p>The opening line of the next tablet is preserved,
it reads: “The gad-fly in the house of the serving-man
was left.” After this the story is again lost for
several lines, and where it reappears Izdubar is
mourning for Hea-bani.</p>

<p>The fragments of this tablet are:—</p>

<p>This is the bottom of the first column. The next
column has lost all the upper part: it appears to have
contained the remainder of this lament, an appeal to
one of the gods on behalf of Hea-bani, and a repetition
of the lamentation, the third person being used instead
of the second. The fragments commence in

<img src="images/i_300.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Xisuthrus or Noah and Izdubar; from an Early
Babylonian Cylinder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This passage closes the great Epic of the ancient
Chaldeans, which even in its present mutilated form is
of the greatest importance in relation to the civilization,
manners, and customs of that early people. The main
feature in this part of the Izdubar legends is the
description of the Flood in the eleventh tablet, which
evidently refers to the same event as the Flood of
Noah in Genesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>The episode of the Flood has been introduced into
the Izdubar Epic in accordance with the principle
upon which it has been formed. The eleventh tablet
or book answers to the sign of Aquarius and the
month called “the rainy” by the Accadians, and it
was therefore rightly occupied by the story of the
Flood. The compiler of the Epic seems to have used
for this purpose two independent poems relating to
the event; at least it is otherwise difficult to account
for the repetitions observable in certain lines which
sometimes differ slightly from one another, as well as
for certain inconsistencies which the skill of the compiler
has not been able entirely to remove. Thus according
to I. 13, the Deluge was caused by all “the
great gods;” according to II. 30, by Samas only;
according to IV. 4, 5, by Bel. There is little doubt
that many independent versions of the history of the
Deluge were current in a poetical form; indeed, a
fragment of one of these, containing the original Accadian
text along with the Assyrian translation has
been preserved, and the version found in Berosus
differs in several notable points from the version embodied
in the great Chaldean Epic.</p>

<p>The fragment of the variant version of which the
Accadian text has been preserved is as follows:—</p>

<ul><li>1. .... then like a bowl of sacrificial wine the
mountain ....</li>

<li>2. .... country to country ran together.</li>

<li>3. The female-slave to her mother (?) it had
caused to ascend.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></li>

<li>4. The freeman from the house of his fecundity it
had caused to go forth.</li>

<li>5. The son from the house of his father it had
caused to go forth</li>

<li>6. The doves from their cotes had fled away.</li>

<li>7. The raven on its wing it had caused to ascend.</li>

<li>8. The swallow from his nest it had caused to
depart.</li>

<li>9. The oxen it had scattered, the lambs it had
scattered.</li>

<li>10. (It was) the great days when the evil spirits
hunt.</li>

<li>11. The universe they subjected unto themselves.</li>

<li>12. Among the bricks of the foundations (they
dealt destruction).</li>

<li>13. The earth like a potsherd (they shattered).</li>

<li>14. Bel and Beltis the supreme ones the mighty
tablets (of destiny consulted).</li>

<li>15. The foot to the earth they did not (put).</li>

<li>16. The highways of the earth they did not (tread).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we compare the Babylonian account of the
Deluge contained in the Epic with the account in
Genesis we shall find some differences between them;
but if we consider the differences that existed between
the two countries of Palestine and Babylonia these
variations do not appear greater than we should
expect. Chaldea was essentially a mercantile and
maritime country, well watered and flat, while Palestine
was a hilly region with no great rivers, and the
Jews were shut out from the coast, the maritime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
regions being mostly in the hands of the Philistines
and Phœnicians. There was a total difference between
the religious ideas of the two peoples, the
Jews believing in one God, the creator and lord of
the Universe, while the Babylonians worshipped gods
and lords many, every city having its local deity,
and these being joined by complicated relations in a
poetical mythology, which was in marked contrast
to the severe simplicity of the Jewish system. With
such differences it was only natural that, in relating
the same stories, each nation should colour them in
accordance with its own ideas, and stress would
naturally in each case be laid upon points with which
they were familiar. Thus we should expect beforehand
that there would be differences in the narrative
such as we actually find, and we may also notice that
the cuneiform account does not always coincide even
with the account of the same events given by Berosus
from Chaldean sources, from which, as already observed,
we may infer that there was more than one
version of the story of the Deluge current in Babylonia
itself.</p>

<p>The great value of the inscriptions describing the
Flood consists in the fact that they form an independent
testimony to the Biblical narrative at a much
earlier date than any other evidence. The principal
points in the two narratives compared in their order
will serve to show the correspondences and differences
between the two. It must, however, be remembered
that the Biblical narrative is composed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
two different accounts of the Flood, generally known
as the Elohistic and Jehovistic, and, as M. Lenormant
has observed, it is with the union of the two in our
present Hebrew text rather than with either one of
them alone that the Babylonian version corresponds.
The repetitions observable in the Hebrew text are
not to be found in the cuneiform text.</p>

<p>One of the first points that strike us on comparing
the Biblical and cuneiform accounts together is that
they both agree in representing the Flood as a punishment
for the sins of mankind. This agreement is
rendered remarkable by the absence of such a moral
cause in the legends of a deluge current among other
nations; it is wanting even in the version of the
Babylonian account given by Berosus. Equally remarkable
is the agreement of the two accounts in the
narrative of the sending forth of the birds, two of
which, the raven and the dove, are the same in both.
Some of the actual phrases and words found in Genesis
are also found in the cuneiform tablet; though sometimes
they are modified, as when Genesis says of the
entrance of Noah into the ark: “The Lord shut him
in;” whereas in the Babylonian narrative the closing
of the door is ascribed to Xisuthrus himself.</p>

<p>Positive discrepancies, however, occur between the
two records. Thus they differ as regards the size of
the ark. According to the cuneiform account, its
length and breadth were in the proportion of ten to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
one and the height and breadth were the same; but
the Bible makes the proportion as six to one, and
describes the height as being thirty cubits and the
breadth fifty. The version of the story given by
Berosus, on the other hand, agrees in this matter
neither with Genesis nor with the tablet from Erech.
It measures the ark by stadia and not by cubits,
makes the proportion of its length and breadth as
five to two, and says nothing of the height.</p>

<p>Another difference may be found in the description
of the patriarch who escapes the Flood. Xisuthrus is
a king who enters the ark with his servants, people,
and pilot, while in the Bible only Noah and his family
are saved. So, too, no reference is made in the Babylonian
account to the distinction between the clean
and unclean animals mentioned by the Jehovist,
though seven was a sacred number among the Babylonians.
The most remarkable difference, however,
between the two accounts is with respect to the
duration of the Deluge. On this point the inscription
gives seven days for the Flood, and seven days for the
resting of the ark on the mountain, while the Elohist
puts the commencement of the Flood on the 17th day
of the second month (Marchesvan) and its termination
on the 27th day of the second month in the following
year, making a total duration of one lunar year and
eleven days. This exactly accords with the climatic
conditions of Babylonia, where the rains begin at the
end of November. The Euphrates and Tigris then
begin to rise, the country is inundated in March, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
seventh month of the Hebrew narrative, and from
the end of May onwards the waters go down. According
to the Jehovist, however, the Deluge is announced
to Noah only seven days before it takes place; the
waters are at their height for forty days and then
decrease during another forty days, after which the
patriarch sends out the birds at intervals of seven
days, so that it was not till twenty-one days after he
has first opened the window that he finally leaves
the ark. This is in practical agreement with the
cuneiform account, since seven was a sacred number
among the Babylonians just as forty is in the Old
Testament. As M. Lenormant points out, the date
of the 15th of Dæsius (or May) given by Berosus
must be due to a scribe’s error, since this would
place the Flood at a time when the waters were going
down. There is again a difference as to the mountain
on which the ark rested; Nizir, the place mentioned
in the cuneiform text, being east of Assyria, and its
mountain, also called “the mountain of the world”
where the gods were supposed to dwell, being the
present peak of Elwend, while the mountains of Ararat
mentioned in the Bible were north of Assyria, near
Lake Van. It is evident that different traditions have
placed the mountain of the ark in totally different
positions, and there is not positive proof as to which
is the earlier traditionary spot. The word Ararat is
connected with a word <i>Urdhu</i>, meaning “highland,”
and might be a general term for any part of the
hilly country to the north-east of Assyria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to find references in the Jehovistic
account to the sacred Babylonian number seven and
the seven-day week. Just as Xisuthrus set vessels by
sevens on the altar of sacrifice, so Noah offered clean
beasts and fowls which had been taken by sevens
into the ark. And the narrative of the sending-out
of the birds contains a clear reference to the seven-day
week, which was known from very early times
to the Accadians, who had named each day after one
of the seven planets. The Sabbath also, which occurred
on the 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st and 28th days of
the lunar month, was rigorously observed by them.
They called it “a day of completion of labours,” or
“a day unlawful to work upon,” and a sort of saints’
calendar for the month of the intercalatory Elul says
that upon it “the shepherd of many peoples may not
eat the flesh of <i>birds</i> (?) or cooked fruit. The garments
of his body he must not change. White robes
he may not put on. Sacrifice he may not offer. The
king in his chariot may not ride. He may not legislate
in royal fashion. A place of garrison the general
by word of mouth may not appoint. Medicine for
the sickness of the body one may not apply.” The
very word <i>Sabattu</i> or Sabbath was used by the
Assyrians, and a bilingual tablet explains it as “a
day of rest for the heart.”</p>

<p>One striking difference between the descriptions of
the Deluge given in the Old Testament and in the
Epic of Izdubar is due to the fact that the Hebrews
were an inland people, whereas the Accadians were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
maritime, or rather fluviatile one. Hence it is that
while the ark is called in the Babylonian version “a
ship,” it is called <i>têbâh</i>, that is, “a coffer” in Genesis.
In Genesis, too, nothing is said about launching the
ark, testing its seaworthiness, or entrusting it to a
pilot. However, the narrative in Genesis preserves a
recollection of the bitumen for which the Babylonian
plain was famous, and like the cuneiform narrative
states that the ark was pitched.</p>

<p>Some of the other differences observable in the
two accounts are evidently due to the opposite
religious systems of the two countries, but there is
again a curious point in connection with the close of
the Chaldean legend: this is the translation of the
hero of the Flood.</p>

<p>In the Book of Genesis it is not Noah but the
seventh patriarch Enoch who is translated, three
generations before the Flood.</p>

<p>There appears to have been some connection
or confusion between Enoch and Noah in ancient
tradition; both are holy men, and Enoch is said, like
Noah, to have predicted the Flood.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the dynasty of gods, with
which Egyptian mythical history commences, resembles
in some respects the list of antediluvian
kings of Babylonia given by Berosus as well as the
list of antediluvian patriarchs in Genesis.</p>

<p>This dynasty has sometimes seven, sometimes ten
reigns, and in the Turin Papyrus of kings, which
gives ten reigns, there is the same name for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
seventh and tenth kings, both being called Horus,
and the seventh king is stated to have reigned 300
years, which is the length of life of the seventh patriarch
Enoch after the birth of his son.</p>

<p>Here are the three lists of Egyptian gods, Hebrew
patriarchs, and Chaldean kings.</p>

<p>It is well known that Enos, like Adam, signifies
“man;” hence some writers have supposed that the
list of Noah’s ancestors was originally counted from
Enos, so that Lamech, Noah’s father, would have been
the seventh in descent. There is, moreover, a curious
resemblance between the names of the descendants of
Seth and those of the descendants of Cain, Methuselah,
indeed, being apparently more correctly written
Methusael (Gen. iv. 18), which is the Assyrian <i>Mutu-sa-ili</i>,
“Man of God.” Now Lamech, the descendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
of Cain, is the seventh from Adam. It may be noticed
that Irad or Jared is the same word as the Assyrian
<i>Arad</i>, “servant,” and <i>Arad</i> or <i>Ardutu</i> is the Assyrian
rendering of the Accadian Ubara, the first part of the
name of the father of Xisuthrus, who is actually
called Ardates by Abydenus.</p>

<p>Mr. George Smith believed that the real connection
between the traditions of Babylonia and Palestine
would never be cleared up until the literature of the
Syrian population which intervened is recovered. It
is very possible that light may be thrown upon the
question by the excavations now being made at Jerablus,
the site of Carchemish, the capital of the ancient
Hittites. Terah may be the same word as Tarkhu,
who seems to have been worshipped as a god by the
Hittites; and Lucian has preserved a legend of the
Flood and the patriarch Sisythes, who is evidently the
Xisuthrus of the Babylonians, which was current at
Hierapolis or Mabug, a little to the south of Jerablus.
In this legend the ark has become a coffer, Sisythes
and his family are alone preserved, and the Flood was
sent to punish the wickedness of mankind.</p>

<p>There is one point which still deserves notice: these
traditions are not fixed to any localities in or near
Palestine, but even on the showing of the Jews themselves,
belong to the neighbourhood of the Euphrates
valley, and Babylonia in particular; this of course is
clearly stated in the Babylonian inscriptions and
traditions.</p>

<p>Eden, according even to the Jews, was by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Euphrates and Tigris; the cities of Babylon, Larancha,
and Sippara were supposed by the Babylonians
to have been founded before the Flood.
Surippak was the city of the ark, the mountains east
of the Tigris were the resting-place of the ark, Babylon
was the site of the tower, and Ur of the Chaldees
the birthplace of Abraham. These facts and the further
statement that Abraham, the father and first leader
of the Hebrew race, migrated from Ur to Harran in
Syria, and from thence to Palestine, are all so much
evidence in favour of the hypothesis that Chaldea was
the original home of these stories, and that the Jews
received them originally from the Babylonians; but
on the other hand there are such striking differences
in some parts of the legends, particularly in the names
of the patriarchs before the Flood, that it is evident
further information is required before we can
determine how or when they were received by the
Jews.</p>

<p>To pass, now, to the twelfth tablet of the Izdubar
Epic, a curious fragment has been provisionally placed
by Mr. Smith in the fourth column, in which Izdubar
appears to call on his cities to mourn with him for his
friend. This tablet is remarkable for the number of
cities mentioned as already existing in the time of
Izdubar. Combining this notice with other early inscriptions,
the statements of Berosus and the notice of
the cities of Nimrod in Genesis, we get the following
list of the oldest known cities in the Euphrates
valley:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>


<ul><li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1. Babylon and its suburb</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">2. Borsippa.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">3. Cutha.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">4. Larsa.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">5. Surippak, called Larancha by Berosus.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">6. Eridu.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">7. Nipur.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">8. Erech.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">9. Calneh.</span></li>
<li>10. Sippara. (Sepharvaim.)</li>
<li>11. Kisu (or Kis).</li>
<li>12. Ganganna.</li>
<li>13. Amarda or Marad.</li>
<li>14. Ur</li>
<li>15. Nisin or Karrak.</li>
<li>16. Agané.</li>
<li>17. Duban or Duran.</li>
<li>18. Abnunna or Mullias.</li>
<li>19. Zirghul.</li>
</ul>


<p>To these we may also add the great cities of
Assyria:—</p>


<ul><li>20. Assur, the primitive capital.</li>
<li>21. Ninua or Nineveh.</li>
<li>22. Calah.</li>
<li>23. Resen (Assyrian Res-eni, “the head of the spring.”)</li>
</ul>


<p>So far as the various statements go, all these cities
and probably many others were in existence in the
time of Nimrod, and some of them even before the
Flood; the fact that the Babylonians four thousand
years ago believed their cities to be of such antiquity,
shows that they were not recent foundations,
and the attainments of the people at that time in the
arts and sciences prove that their civilization had
already known ages of progress. The legendary epoch
of Izdubar must be considered at present as the commencement
of the united monarchy in Babylonia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
as marking the first of the series of great conquests in
Western Asia; but how far back we have to go from
our earliest known monuments to reach this era we
cannot now tell.</p>

<p>Every nation has its hero, and it was only natural
that when the Accadian kings of Ur at last succeeded
in establishing an united empire throughout Babylonia,
the legends of the national hero should be
coloured by the new conception of imperial unity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Scattered</span> through various cuneiform
inscriptions are other notices, names, or
passages, connected with the Book of
Genesis. Although the names of the
Genesis patriarchs are not in the inscriptions which
give the history of the mythical period, nevertheless
some of the patriarchal names of Genesis are found
here and there in the inscriptions.</p>

<p>The name Adam is in the Creation legends, but
only in a general sense as man, as in Gen. i. 26, 27,
28.; v. 1, not as a proper name. Several of the
other names of antediluvian patriarchs correspond
with Babylonian words and roots, such as Methusael
(Gen. iv. 18), which is the Assyrian <i>mutu-sa-ili</i>,
“man of God,” and has been changed into Methuselah
(Gen. v. 21) in order to assimilate it to the genius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
of the Hebrew language, or Noah, the Assyrian
nukhu, “rest;” but, besides these, certain names
appear as proper names also in Babylonia, among
them Cainan, Lamech, and Laban.</p>

<p>Cainan is found as the name of a Babylonian town
Kan-nan; the inhabitants of which were sometimes
called Kanunai, which must not be confounded with
the name of the Canaanites or “lowlanders,” originally
the inhabitants of the coastland of Phœnicia
and then, by extension, of all Palestine.</p>

<p>Lamech has already been pointed out by Palmer
(“Egyptian Chronicles,” vol. i. p. 56), in the name
of the deified Phœnician patriarch Diamich; this
name is found in the cuneiform texts as Dumugu and
Lamga, two forms of the Accadian name of the
moon.</p>

<p>The two wives of Lamech, Adah and Zillah, seem
to be the Assyrian <i>edhutu</i> or <i>edhatu</i> “darkness,” and
<i>tsillatu</i> “the shades of night;” and the names of his
two sons Jabal and Jubal are but varying forms of
the Assyrian <i>abil</i> “son.” Dr. Oppert long ago
pointed out that this Assyrian word was the origin of
the name Abel which has been assimilated in spelling
to a Hebrew word signifying “mere breath.”</p>

<p>Some of the names of the patriarchs after the Flood
are found as names of towns in Syria, but not in
Babylonia; among these are Reu or Ragu, Serug,
and Harran.</p>

<p>Laban, on the other hand, as was first noticed by
Dr. Delitzsch, is mentioned in a list of gods given in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
a cuneiform tablet (published in the “Cuneiform Inscriptions
of Western Asia,” iii. 66, 6.)</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mugheir, the site of Ur of the Chaldees.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The name of Abramu or Abram is found in the
Assyrian inscriptions in the time of Esarhaddon.
After the captivity of the ten tribes, some of the Israelites
prospered in Assyria, and rose to positions of
trust in the empire. Abram was one of these, he was
sukulu rabu or “great attendant” of Esarhaddon,
and was eponym in Assyria, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 677. Various other
Hebrew names are found in Assyria about this time,
including Pekah, Hoshea, and several compounded
with the two Divine names Elohim and Jehovah,
showing that both these names were in use among
the Israelites. The presence of proper names
founded on the Genesis stories, like Abram, and the
use at this time of these forms of the Divine name,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
should be taken into consideration in discussing the
evidence of the antiquity of Genesis.</p>

<p>Ur, now represented by the mounds of Mugheir, on
the western bank of the Euphrates to the south of
Babylon, was the capital of the earliest Accadian
dynasty with which we are acquainted. It was
specially devoted to the worship of the moon-god,
the ruins of whose temple have been discovered
there. Ur was the birthplace of Abraham, in whom
we must see one of those Semitic intruders who
settled among the Accadians, and after adopting
their culture and civilization finally succeeded in
overcoming and supplanting them. It is probable
that it is called <i>Ur Casdim</i>, “Ur of the Casdim,” in
Genesis only proleptically, since Casdim appears to be
the representative of an Assyrian word meaning
“conquerors”—a suitable epithet for the Semitic
tribes after their conquest of Babylonia. The Greek
names Chaldean and Chaldea are of much later
date, being derived from the Kaldai, a small tribe
settled on the Persian Gulf and first mentioned in the
ninth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, who under Merodach-Baladan (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
721-709) possessed themselves of Babylonia and became
so integral a portion of its inhabitants as to
give their name to the whole of them in classical
times.</p>

<p>Some of the Genesis names are found at a comparatively
early date, the first which appears on a
contemporary monument being Ishmael. In the
reign of Khammuragas among the witnesses to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
documents at Larsa in Babylonia, appears a man
named “Abuha son of Ishmael.”</p>

<p>After the time of Abraham the book of Genesis is
concerned with the affairs of Palestine, and of the
countries in its immediate vicinity, and it has no connection
with Babylonian history and traditions;
however, the cuneiform records contain one story
which has a striking likeness to that of Moses in the
ark, and which, although not within the period
covered by Genesis, is of great interest in connection
with the early history of the Jews.</p>

<p>Sargina or Sargon I. was a Babylonian monarch
who reigned in the city of Agané about B.C. 1800.
The name of Sargon signifies the right, true, or legitimate
king, and may have been assumed on his
ascending the throne. Sargon was probably of obscure
origin, and hence the myth that attached itself
to him in later popular belief. This curious story is
found on fragments of tablets from Kouyunjik, and
reads as follows:</p>

<ul><li>1. Sargina the powerful king the king of Agané
am I.</li>

<li>2. My mother was a princess, my father I did
not know, a brother of my father chose the mountains.</li>

<li>3. In the city of Azupiranu which by the side of
the river Euphrates is situated</li>

<li>4. (my) mother the princess conceived me; in an
inaccessible place she brought me forth.</li>

<li>5. She placed me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen
my exit she sealed up.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></li>

<li>6. She launched me on the river which did not
drown me.</li>

<li>7. The river carried me, to Akki the irrigator it
brought me.</li>

<li>8. Akki the irrigator in tenderness of bowels
lifted me up;</li>

<li>9. Akki the irrigator as his child brought me up,</li>

<li>10. Akki the irrigator as his woodman set me,</li>

<li>11. and in my woodmanship Istar loved me.</li>

<li>12. 45? years the kingdom I ruled,</li>

<li>13. the people of the black heads I governed, I ..</li>

<li>14. over rugged countries in many chariots of
bronze I rode,</li>

<li>15. I governed the upper countries,</li>

<li>16. I ruled? over the chiefs of the lower countries.</li>

<li>17. To the sea coast three times I advanced, Dilvun
(in the Persian Gulf) submitted,</li>

<li>18. Durankigal bowed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this follows an address to any king who
should at a later time notice the inscription.</p>

<p>This myth is but a repetition of the oft-told story,
how the hero of noble birth is born in secret, is exposed
to death, but is rescued and brought up in a
humble sphere of life until the time comes when his
true origin and character are revealed, and he becomes
a mighty prince and conqueror. The legend was
told of Perseus in Greece, of Romulus in Italy, of
Cyrus in Persia. But just as Cyrus was a real personage
upon whom the legend was fastened, so too
Sargon was a real personage, who founded the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
library of Agané, and extended his conquests as far
as the island of Cyprus, which he conquered in the
third year of his reign.</p>

<p>The most hazardous of the theories put forward
in the preceding chapters is the one which identifies
Izdubar with Nimrod, and makes him reign in the
legendary period of Babylonian history. This theory
is founded on several plausible, but probably merely
superficial grounds; and if any one accepts Mr.
Smith’s view on the point, it will be only for similar
reasons to those which caused him to propose it;
namely, because, failing this, we have no clue whatever
to the age and position of the most famous hero
in Oriental tradition.</p>

<p>We must never lose sight of the fact that, apart
from the more perfect and main parts of these texts,
both in the decipherment of the broken fragments
and in the various theories projected respecting them,
the Assyrian scholar must change his opinions many
times, and no doubt any accession of new material
would change again our views respecting the parts
affected by it. These theories and conclusions, however,
although not always correct, have, on their way,
assisted the inquiry, and have led to the more accurate
knowledge of the texts; for certainly in cuneiform
matters we have often had to advance through
error to truth.</p>

<p>In adopting Mr. Smith’s theory for the position of
Nimrod, one thing is certainly clear: he is placed as
low in the chronology as it is possible to make him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>The stories and myths given in the foregoing
pages have, probably, very different values; some
are genuine traditions—some compiled to account
for natural phenomena, and some pure romances.
At the head of their history and traditions the
Babylonians placed an account of the creation of the
world; and, although different forms of this story
were current, in certain features they all agreed.
Beside the account of the present animals, they
related the creation of legions of monster forms
which disappeared before the human epoch, and they
accounted for the great problem of humanity—the
presence of evil in the world—by making out that it
proceeded from the original chaos, the spirit of confusion
and darkness, which was the origin of all
things, and which was even older than the gods.</p>

<p>The principal story of the Creation, given in
Chapter V., substantially agrees, as far as it is preserved,
with the Biblical account. According to it,
there was a chaos of watery matter before the Creation,
and from this all things were generated.</p>

<p>We have then a considerable blank, the contents
of which we can only conjecture, and after this we
come to the creation of the heavenly orbs.</p>

<p>The fifth tablet in the series relates how God
created the constellations of the stars, the signs of the
zodiac, the planets and other stars, the moon and the
sun. After another blank we have a fragment
which relates to the creation of wild and domestic
animals; it is curious here that the original taming of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
domestic animals was even then so far back in the
history of the race that all knowledge of it was lost,
and the “animals of the city,” or domestic animals,
were considered different creations from the “animals
of the desert,” or “field,” or wild animals.</p>

<p>We next come to the war between the dragon and
powers of evil, or chaos, on one side and the gods on
the other. The gods have weapons forged for them,
and Merodach undertakes to lead the heavenly host
against the dragon. The war, which is described
with spirit, ends of course in the triumph of the
principle of good, and the overthrow of primeval
anarchy.</p>

<p>In Chapter V. another account of the Creation
is given which differs materially from the first. The
principal feature in the second account is the description
of the eagle-headed men with their family
of leaders—this legend clearly showing the origin of
the eagle-headed figures represented on the Assyrian
sculptures.</p>

<p>It is probable that some of these Babylonian legends
contained detailed descriptions of the Garden
of Eden, which seems to have been the district of
Eridu in the south of Babylonia, as Sir Henry Rawlinson
believes.</p>

<p>There are coincidences in respect to the geography
of the region and its name which render the identification
very probable; of the four rivers in each case,
two, the Euphrates and Tigris, are identical; then,
again, the known fertility of the region, its name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
sometimes Gan-duni, so similar to Gan-eden (the
Garden of Eden), and other considerations, all
tend towards the view that it is the Paradise of
Genesis.</p>

<p>There are evidences of the belief in the tree of
life, which is one of the most common emblems on
the seals and larger sculptures, and is even used
as an ornament on dresses; a sacred tree is also several
times mentioned in the legends and hymns, but at
present there is no direct connection known between
the tree and the Fall, although the gem engravings
render it very probable that there was a legend of
this kind like the one in Genesis.</p>

<p>In the history of Berosus mention is made of a
composite being, half man, half fish, named Oannes,
who was supposed to have appeared out of the
sea and to have taught the Babylonians all their
learning. The Babylonian and Assyrian sculptures
have made us familiar with the figure of Oannes, and
have so far given evidence that Berosus has truly
described this mythological figure; but it is a curious
fact that the legend of Oannes, which must have been
one of the Babylonian stories of the Creation, has not
yet been recovered. In fact, as previously noticed
(p. 12), there is only one fragment which can be at
all referred to it, and this has been accidentally preserved
among a series of extracts from various
Accadian works in a bilingual reading-book compiled
for the use of Assyrian students of Accadian. The
fragment is as follows:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_325f.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Oannes. From Nimroud Sculpture.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<ul><li>1. To the waters their god</li>

<li>2. has returned:</li>

<li>3. to the house of bright things</li>

<li>4. he descended (as) an icicle:</li>

<li>5. on a seat of snow</li>

<li>6. he grew not old in wisdom.</li>
</ul>

<p>The legend of Oannes, whose name may possibly
be the Accadian Hea-khan, “Hea the fish,” concerned
the Babylonians only, and so did not interest
the Assyrians, who did not care to have it in their
libraries.</p>

<p>Besides the legend of Oannes, however, there
are evidently many stories of early times still
unknown, or only known by mere fragments or
allusions.</p>

<p>The fables given in Chapter IX. form a series
quite different in character from the legends, and the
only excuse for inserting them here is the need of
exhibiting as clearly and fully as possible the
literature of the great epoch which produced the
Genesis tablets.</p>

<p>Most of the other stories apparently relate to the
great period before the Flood, when celestial visitors
came to and from the earth, and the inhabitants
of the world were very distinctly divided into the
good and bad, but the stories are only fables with a
moral attached, and have little connection with Babylonian
history.</p>

<p>Two of these stories are very curious, and may
hereafter turn out to be of great importance; one is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
the story of the sin committed by the god Zu, and
the other the story of Atarpi.</p>

<p>Berosus in his history has given an account of ten
Chaldean kings who reigned before the Flood, and the
close of this period is well known from the descriptions
of the Deluge in the Bible, the Deluge tablet, and the
work of the Greek writer. According to Berosus
several of the Babylonian cities were built before the
Flood, and various arts were known, including writing.
The enormous reigns given by Berosus to his ten
kings, making a total of 432,000 years, force us to discard
the idea that the details are historical, although
there may be some foundation for his statement of a
civilization before the Deluge. The details given in
the inscriptions describing the Flood leave no doubt
that both the Bible and the Babylonian story describe
the same event, and the Flood becomes the starting-point
for the modern world in both histories. According
to Berosus 86 kings reigned for 34,080 years after
the Flood down to the Median conquest. If these
kings are historical, it is doubtful if they formed a
continuous line, and they could scarcely cover a longer
period than 2,000 years. The Median or Elamite
conquest took place about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2700, and, if we allow
the round number 2,000 years for the previous
period, it will make the Flood fall about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 4700.
In a fragmentary inscription with a list of Babylonian
kings, some names are given which appear to belong
to the 86 kings of Berosus, but our information about
this period is so scanty that nothing can be said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
about this dynasty, and a suggestion as to the date
of the Deluge must be received with more than the
usual grain of salt.</p>

<p>We can see, however, that there was a civilized
race in Babylonia before the Median Conquest, the
progress of which must have received a rude shock
when the country was overrun by the uncivilized
Eastern borderers.</p>

<p>Among the fragmentary notices of this semi-mythical
period is the portion of the inscription describing
the building of the Tower of Babel and the
dispersion.</p>

<p>It is probable from the fragments of Berosus that
the incursions and dominion of the Median Elamites
lasted about two hundred years, during which the
country suffered greatly from them.</p>

<p>The legends of Izdubar or Nimrod commence with
a description of the evils brought upon Babylonia by
foreign invasion, the conquest and sacking of the city
of Erech being one of the incidents in the story.
Izdubar, a famous hunter, who claimed descent from
a long line of kings, reaching up to the time of the
Flood, now comes forward; he has a dream, and after
much trouble a half-human creature named Hea-bani
is persuaded by Zaidu, the hunter, and two females,
to come to Erech and interpret the dream of Izdubar.
Hea-bani, having heard the fame of Izdubar, brings to
Erech a midannu or tiger to test his strength, and
Izdubar slays it. After these things, Izdubar and
Hea-bani become friends, and, having invoked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
gods, they start to attack the tyrant Khumbaba.
Khumbaba dwelt in a thick forest, surrounded by a
wall, and here he was visited by the two friends, who
slew him and carried off his spoils.</p>

<p>Izdubar was now proclaimed king, and extended
his authority over the Babylonian world, his court and
palace being at Erech. The goddess Istar, daughter
of Anu according to one myth, of Bel according to
another, of Sin, the moon god, according to a third,
who had loved the shepherd Tammuz, the Sun-god,
fell in love with Izdubar. He refused her offers,
and the goddess, angry at his answer, ascended to
heaven and petitioned her father Anu to create a bull
for her, to be an instrument of her vengeance. Anu
complied, and created the bull, on which Izdubar and
Hea-bani collected a band of warriors and went against
it. Hea-bani took hold of the animal by its head and
tail, while Izdubar slew it.</p>

<p>Istar on this cursed Izdubar, and descended to
Hades to attempt once more to summon unearthly
powers against the hero. She descends to the infernal
regions, which are vividly described, and, passing
through their seven gates, is ushered into the presence
of the queen of the dead. The world of love goes
wrong in the absence of Istar, and on the petition of
the gods she is once more brought to the earth,
ultimately Anatu, her mother, satisfying her vengeance
by striking Izdubar with a loathsome disease.</p>

<p>Hea-bani, the friend of Izdubar, is now killed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
Izdubar, mourning his double affliction, abandons his
kingdom and wanders into the desert to seek the
advice of Xisuthrus his ancestor, who had been
translated for his piety and now dwelt with the
gods.</p>

<p>Izdubar now had a dream, and after this wandered
to the region where gigantic composite monsters held
and controlled the rising and setting sun: from these
he learned the road to the region of the blessed, and,
passing across a great waste of sand, arrived at a
region where splendid trees were laden with jewels
instead of fruit.</p>

<p>Izdubar then met two females, named Siduri and
Sabitu, after an adventure with whom he found a
boatman named Nes-Hea, who undertook to navigate
him to the region where Xisuthrus dwelt.</p>

<p>Coming near the dwelling of the blessed, he found
it surrounded by the waters of death, which he had
to cross in order to reach the land of which he was in
search.</p>

<p>On arriving at the other side, Izdubar was met by
Mu-seri-ina-namari, “the waters of dawn at daybreak,”
who engaged him in conversation about
Hea-bani, and then Xisuthrus, taking up the conversation,
described to him the Deluge. Izdubar was
afterwards cured of his illness and returned with
Nes-Hea to Erech, where he mourned anew for his
friend Hea-bani, and on intercession with the gods
the ghost of Hea-bani arose from the ground where
the body had lain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>The details of this story, and especially the accounts
of the regions inhabited by the dead, are very
striking, and illustrate, in a wonderful manner, the
religious views of the people.</p>

<p>It is worth while here to pause, and consider the
evidence of the existence of the legends recounted
in the preceding pages from the close of the mythical
period down to the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We have first the seals: of these there are some
hundreds in European museums, and among the
earliest are many specimens carved with scenes from
the Genesis legends; some of these are a good deal
older than <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2000, others may be ranged at various
dates down to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1500.</p>

<p>With three exceptions, which are of Assyrian
origin, all the seals engraved in the present volume
are Babylonian. One very fine and early example is
photographed as the frontispiece of the book. The
character and style of the cuneiform legend which
accompanies this shows it to be one of the most
ancient specimens; it is engraved on a hard jasper
cylinder in bold style, and is a remarkable example
of early Babylonian art. Many other similar cylinders
of the same period are known; the relief on them is
bolder than on the later seals, on which from about
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1600 or 1700, a change in the inscriptions becomes
general.</p>

<p>The numerous illustrations to the present work,
which have been collected from these early Babylonian
seals, will serve to show that the legends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
were well known, and formed part of the literature
of the country before the second millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>After <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1500, the literature of Babylonia is
unknown, and we lose sight of all evidence of its
legends for some centuries. In the meantime Egypt
supplies a few notices bearing on the subject, which
serve to show that knowledge of them was still kept
up. Nearly thirteen hundred years before the
Christian era one of the Egyptian poems likens a
hero to the Assyrian chief, Kazartu, a great hunter.
Kazartu probably means a “strong” or “powerful”
one, and it has already been suggested that the
reference is to the hero Nimrod. A little later, in
the period extending from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1000 to 800, we have
in Egypt several persons named Namurot, which
seems to be an echo of the name of the mighty
hunter.</p>

<p>On the revival of the Assyrian empire, about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
990, we come again to numerous references to the
Genesis legends, and these continue through almost
every reign down to the close of the empire. The
Assyrians carved the sacred tree and cherubim on
their walls, they depicted in the temples the struggle
between Merodach and the dragon, they decorated
their portals with the figure of Izdubar strangling a
lion, and carved the struggles of Izdubar and Hea-bani
with the lion and the bull even on their stone
vases.</p>

<p>Just as the sculptures of the Greek temples, the
paintings on the vases and the carving on their gems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
were taken from their myths and legends, so the
series of myths and legends belonging to the valley of
the Euphrates furnished materials for the sculptor,
the engraver, and the painter, among the ancient
Babylonians and Assyrians.</p>

<p>In this way we have continued evidence of the
existence of these legends down to the time of Assur-bani-pal,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 673 to 626, who caused the present
known copies to be made for his library at Nineveh.</p>

<p>Search in Babylonia would, no doubt, yield much
earlier copies of all these works, but that search has
not yet been instituted, and for the present we have
to be contented with our Assyrian copies. Looking,
however, at the world-wide interest of the subjects,
and at the important evidence which perfect copies of
these works would undoubtedly give, there can be no
doubt that further progress will be made in research
and discovery, and that all that is here written
will one day be superseded by newer texts and fuller
and more perfect light.</p>

<p class="center">A NEW EDITION NOW READY OF<br />
<big>Assyrian Discoveries.</big></p>

<p class="center">An Account of Explorations and Discoveries on the
Site of Nineveh during 1873 and 1874.</p>

<p class="center">By GEORGE SMITH,<br />

<small><i>Late of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, British Museum</i>.</small></p>

<p class="center small">
With Maps, Wood-Cuts, and Photographs.<span class="gap4">One Vol. 8vo.</span><br />
Cloth, $4.00.</p>


<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<div class="small">
<p><i>From the N. Y. Daily Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smith appears to have engaged in his work with equal ardor, perseverance,
and good judgment. His habits as a scholar have not impaired his efficiency as a
practical man. The recital of his experience is marked by frankness, modesty, and
great intelligence.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>From the St. Louis Democrat.</i></p>

<p>“The book reveals much of the hitherto hidden history of the Assyrian empire, and
shows that its people were wise in many things. The maxims translated from the
records, and the curious devices and pictures brought to the earth’s surface, give us a
clearer knowledge of the character of the people that inhabited that nation than we have
gained from any other source. * * * It is a work of great importance, and
will be welcomed by all scholars and antiquaries.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>From the N. Y. Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Smith’s book is, in clearness and accuracy, all that could be wished; himself a
great authority on Assyrian antiquities, he has prepared a work which no person who has
studied, or intends to study, this fascinating subject should fail to read.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>From the Cincinnati Commercial.</i></p>

<p>“It is in the hope that these rich, first fruits of investigation will stimulate inquiry,
and induce the British Government to take hold of the matter, and bring its influence to
bear in such a manner upon the Ottoman Government as to secure its co-operation in
prosecuting a thorough system of investigation, that we close Mr. Smith’s absorbingly
interesting book.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>From the Watchman and Reflector.</i></p>

<p>“His book is a simple, straightforward record of what he accomplished, written not
to catch the applause of the ignorant, but to inform the wise and the thoughtful. The
narrative of personal experience is interesting, without trace of straining for sensational
effect. But the chief value of the work is for its account of things accomplished.”</p>

<p class="center small">The Origin and Growth of Religion, as Illustrated by<br />

<big><i>THE RELIGION OF<br />
ANCIENT EGYPT</i>.</big>
</p>

<div class="small">
<p class="center">By P. LE PAGE RENOUF.<br />

<small>(<i>The Hibbert Lectures for 1879.</i>)</small></p>

<p class="center">
One volume, 12mo,<span class="gap4">$1.50</span>
</p>


<blockquote>

<p>M. Le Page Renouf’s great reputation as an Egyptologist led to his
selection to deliver the second course of the already celebrated Hibbert
series. His lectures are the fit companions of Professor Müller’s, both in
learning and in interest. The glimpses laboriously gained by the aid of
long undeciphered hieroglyphics into one of the most mystical and profound
of all the ancient beliefs, have always had a special fascination; and the
time has now come when it is possible to join their results into a fairly
complete picture. Done as this is by M. Renouf, with a certain French
vividness and clearness, it has a very unusual, and, indeed, unique interest.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">CRITICAL NOTICES.</p>

<p>“The narrative is so well put together, the chain of reasoning and
inference so obvious, and the illustration so apt, that the general reader
can go through it with unabated interest.”—<i>Hartford Post.</i></p>

<p>“No one can rise from reading this book, in which, by the way, the
author is careful about drawing his conclusions, without having increased
respect for the religion of ancient Egypt, and hardly less than admiration
for its ethical system.”—<i>The Churchman.</i></p>

<p>“These lectures are invaluable to students of Egyptology, and as the
religion of ancient Egypt stands alone and unconnected with other religions,
except those which have been modified by it, itself being apparently original
and underived, they should be highly interesting to all students of religious
history.... It is impossible in a brief notice to convey an adequate
idea of Professor Renouf’s admirable lectures.”—<i>N. Y. World.</i></p>

<p>“The present work forms a remarkably intelligent and acutely critical
contribution to the history of the origin and growth of religion, as illustrated
by the religion of ancient Egypt. As a specialist, Professor Renouf is able
to bring forth much information not ordinarily accessible to the general
reader, and this he does in such a carefully digested form as to make the
work entertaining and instructive in the highest degree.”—<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

ANCIENT MYCENÆ AND TIRYNS.</i></p>

<p class="center">CRITICAL NOTICES.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In this magnificent volume we have
finally the story of Dr. Schliemann’s last
and most important discoveries. He has
been the most fortunate of archæological
explorers; for even a greater luck than
rewarded him in the Troad has fallen to
his portion in Argolis. * * * We suspect
that the final verdict of scholars will
that Dr. Schliemann has actually discovered
the remains of the man, some part
of whose history, at least, is preserved in
the Agamemnon of Homer and Æschylus.”—<i>The
N. Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Schliemann’s book is worth all the
prolegomens and commentaries upon Homer
that have been written since the revival
of learning.”—<i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>“The interest of the work is not confined
to either England or America. Every enlightened
nation will welcome it, for it opens
up a new world to the modern generation.
No work of the time has attracted wider
attention.”—<i>Boston Post.</i></p>

<p>“This splendid volume is a museum of
itself which every lover of history and
classical literature will feel that he must
possess, and which any intelligent reader
is competent to understand and enjoy by
means of its abundant and truly splendid
illustrations.”—<i>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Schliemann has made the most
important contribution of the present century
to Greek archæology.”—<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>“We commend the volume, with its admirable
typography and multitudinous illustrations,
to the attention of our readers,
assuring them that they will find it possessed
of a rare and enduring interest.”—<i>Boston
Journal.</i></p>

<p>“We add our testimony in saying that a
copy of Mycenæ is necessary to the library
of every scholar, and—which is no mean
praise—that the printing and illustrations
of this work are worthy of the matter.”—<i>Baltimore
Gazette.</i></p></blockquote>

<i>The<br />
<big>Conflict of Christianity</big></i>
</p>

<p class="center">WITH HEATHENISM.</p>

<p class="center">By DR. GERHARD UHLHORN.</p>

<p class="center"><i>TRANSLATED BY</i></p>

<p class="center">PROF. EGBERT C. SMYTH and REV. C. J. H. ROPES.</p>
<div class="small">
<p class="center">One Volume, Crown 8vo, $2.50.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>This volume describes with extraordinary vividness and spirit the
religious and moral condition of the Pagan world, the rise and spread
of Christianity, its conflict with heathenism, and its final victory. There
is no work that portrays the heroic age of the ancient church with equal
spirit, elegance, and incisive power. The author has made thorough and
independent study both of the early Christian literature and also of the
contemporary records of classic heathenism.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">CRITICAL NOTICES.</p>

<p>“It is easy to see why this volume is so highly esteemed. It is
systematic, thorough, and concise. But its power is in the wide mental
vision and well-balanced imagination of the author, which enable him to
reconstruct the scenes of ancient history. An exceptional clearness and
force mark his style.”—<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“One might read many books without obtaining more than a fraction
of the profitable information here conveyed; and he might search a long
time before finding one which would so thoroughly fix his attention and
command his interest.”—<i>Phil. S. S. Times.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Uhlhorn has described the great conflict with the power of a
master. His style is strong and attractive, his descriptions vivid and
graphic, his illustrations highly colored, and his presentation of the subject
earnest and effective.”—<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p>“The work is marked for its broad humanitarian views, its learning,
and the wide discretion in selecting from the great field the points of
deepest interest.”—<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p>“This is one of those clear, strong, thorough-going books which are
a scholar’s delight.”—<i>Hartford Religious Herald.</i></p>
